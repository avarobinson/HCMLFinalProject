1329150897641951233 2020-11-18 11:54:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you @DarrellIssa, so nice!   https://t.co/FlUfzV7pSQ

1329097946776940559 2020-11-18 08:23:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> FLOYD COUNTY, GEORGIA!   https://t.co/mIZ5rmdkvw
1329093126238203905 2020-11-18 08:04:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Great State of Michigan, with votes being far greater than the number of people who voted, cannot certify the election. The Democrats cheated big time, and got caught. A Republican WIN!
1329087255168708608 2020-11-18 07:41:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In Detroit, there are FAR MORE VOTES THAN PEOPLE. Nothing can be done to cure that giant scam. I win Michigan!
1329086548093014022 2020-11-18 07:38:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The numbers have not improved, it is still 71% out of balance”, stated Wayne County, Michigan,  Canvassers. “There is widespread irregularities in poll numbers.” There are “more votes than people”. The two harassed patriot Canvassers refuse to sign the papers!
1329075487553974275 2020-11-18 06:54:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THEY WOULD’NT LET REPUBLICAN POLL WATCHERS INTO THE COUNTING ROOMS. UNCONSTITUTIONAL!!!
1329069814195871744 2020-11-18 06:31:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Georgia recount is a joke and is being done UNDER PROTEST. Even though thousands of fraudulent votes have been found, the real number is in matching signatures. Governor must open up the unconstitutional Consent Decree and call in the Legislature!
1329065945160175616 2020-11-18 06:16:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They didn’t even allow Republican Observers into the building to watch. A terrible insult to our Constitution!
1329064787142172673 2020-11-18 06:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This was a rigged election. No Republican Poll Watchers allowed, voting machine “glitches” all over the place (meaning they got caught cheating!), voting after election ended, and so much more!
1329060562442067969 2020-11-18 05:55:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wrong! At first they voted against because there were far more VOTES than PEOPLE (Sad!). Then they were threatened, screamed at and viciously harassed, and were FORCED to change their vote, but then REFUSED, as American patriots, to sign the documents. 71% MESS. Don’t Harass!
1329054683441278977 2020-11-18 05:31:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...AND I WON THE ELECTION. VOTER FRAUD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY!
1329050677541281795 2020-11-18 05:15:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Trump votes.
1328900747497525248 2020-11-17 19:20:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Governor Kemp will hopefully see the light before it is too late. Must finally take charge! Two GREAT Senators, who do so much for Georgia and truly love the USA, are in a must win battle with two incompetents who don’t have a clue!
1328886891765182466 2020-11-17 18:24:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Well, it’s really quite simple. You just can’t have more votes than people!
1328886157246156801 2020-11-17 18:22:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> More votes than people, and that is the least of it!!!
1328885313729687553 2020-11-17 18:18:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Flip Michigan back to TRUMP. Detroit, not surprisingly, has tremendous problems!
1328883405837258753 2020-11-17 18:11:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Michigan just refused to certify the election results! Having courage is a beautiful thing. The USA stands proud!

1328856932011167744 2020-11-17 16:25:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The only thing secure about our 2020 Election was that it was virtually impenetrable by foreign powers. On that, the Trump Administration takes great credit. Unfortunately, the Radical Left Democrats, Dominion, and others, were perhaps more successful!
1328853928025403394 2020-11-17 16:14:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THANK YOU!  https://t.co/DrtsiD71i4

1328801981222281216 2020-11-17 12:47:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I have reversed the ridiculous decision to cancel Wreaths Across America at Arlington National Cemetery. It will now go on!

1328483862490574849 2020-11-16 15:43:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Big victory moments ago in the State of Nevada. The all Democrat County Commissioner race, on same ballot as President, just thrown out because of large scale voter discrepancy. Clark County officials do not have confidence in their own election security. Major impact!
1328448530504163329 2020-11-16 13:23:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The rate of rejected Mail-In Ballots is 30 X’s lower in Pennsylvania this year than it was in 2016. This is why they kept our poll watchers and observers out of the “SACRED” vote counting rooms!  https://t.co/QPlzfimbd4
1328382287331856384 2020-11-16 08:59:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Georgia won’t let us look at the all important signature match. Without that the recount is MEANINGLESS. Open up unconstitutional Consent Decree, NOW! @BrianKempGA
1328370030678044675 2020-11-16 08:11:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> European Countries are sadly getting clobbered by the China Virus. The Fake News does not like reporting this!

1328361451497664512 2020-11-16 07:37:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Radical Left Democrats, working with their partner, the Fake News Media, are trying to STEAL this Election. We won’t let them!
1328359565574991872 2020-11-16 07:29:34 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Trump Campaign Rejects Media Reports of Changed Pennsylvania Case  https://t.co/VjIhiyB4XK via @BreitbartNews. Just more Fake News. Harassment and exclusion of our Poll Watchers is a big part of our case. Unconstitutional!
1328349382023000064 2020-11-16 06:49:06 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Who will be running for Governor of the Great State of Ohio? Will be hotly contested!
1328341927641681922 2020-11-16 06:19:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Another Vaccine just announced. This time by Moderna, 95% effective. For those great “historians”, please remember that these great discoveries, which will end the China Plague, all took place on my watch!
1328338630679597056 2020-11-16 06:06:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Try watching @OANN. Really GREAT!
1328338241284616193 2020-11-16 06:04:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake recount going on in Georgia means nothing because they are not allowing signatures to be looked at and verified. Break the unconstitutional Consent Decree!
1328334945148952576 2020-11-16 05:51:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I won the Election!
1328330303103000577 2020-11-16 05:33:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I strongly stand with Kelly &amp; David. They are both great and MUST WIN!
1328328547598000130 2020-11-16 05:26:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Dominion is running our Election. Rigged!
1328328019807776768 2020-11-16 05:24:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Andrew!
1328324377168015360 2020-11-16 05:09:45 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Washington Post forgot to read the complaint. Fake News. Poll Watchers, and the way they were treated, are a very big deal in the complaint!
1328200072987893762 2020-11-15 20:55:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I WON THE ELECTION!
1328152466752491526 2020-11-15 17:46:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....owned Dominion Voting Systems, turned down by Texas and many others because it was not good or secure, those responsible for the safeguarding of our Constitution cannot allow the Fake results of the 2020 Mail-In Election to stand. The World is watching!
1328152465016020993 2020-11-15 17:46:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....perhaps like never before! From large numbers of Poll Watchers that were thrown out of vote counting rooms in many of our States, to millions of ballots that have been altered by Democrats, only for Democrats, to voting after the Election was over, to using Radical Left
1328152462331699202 2020-11-15 17:46:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why does the Fake News Media continuously assume that Joe Biden will ascend to the Presidency, not even allowing our side to show, which we are just getting ready to do, how badly shattered and violated our great Constitution has been in the 2020 Election. It was attacked,..
1328137498069970947 2020-11-15 16:47:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A great launch! @NASA was a closed up disaster when we took over. Now it is again the “hottest”, most advanced, space center in the world, by far!
1328100945570500608 2020-11-15 14:21:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Many of the court cases being filed all over the Country are not ours, but rather those of people that have seen horrible abuses. Our big cases showing the unconstitutionality of the 2020 Election, &amp; the outrage of things that were done to change the outcome, will soon be filed!
1328094310294822917 2020-11-15 13:55:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Spirit like never before!

1328055196904251397 2020-11-15 11:20:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> John Bolton was one of the dumbest people in government that I’ve had the “pleasure” to work with. A sullen, dull and quiet guy, he added nothing to National Security except, “Gee, let’s go to war.” Also, illegally released much Classified Information. A real dope!

1327979630477922304 2020-11-15 06:19:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!
1327978710809661440 2020-11-15 06:16:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> RIGGED ELECTION. WE WILL WIN!
1327960545929072645 2020-11-15 05:04:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Watch @RudyGiuliani interview on @MariaBartiromo this morning at 10:00. Doing a great job exposing the Rigged Election Hoax!
1327958640309972992 2020-11-15 04:56:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> All of the mechanical “glitches” that took place on Election Night were really THEM getting caught trying to steal votes. They succeeded plenty, however, without getting caught. Mail-in elections are a sick joke!
1327956491056279552 2020-11-15 04:47:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He won because the Election was Rigged. NO VOTE WATCHERS OR OBSERVERS allowed, vote tabulated by a Radical Left privately owned company, Dominion, with a bad reputation &amp; bum equipment that couldn’t even qualify for Texas (which I won by a lot!), the Fake &amp; Silent Media, &amp; more!
1327950785959915520 2020-11-15 04:25:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is why @FoxNews daytime and weekend daytime have lost their ratings. They are abysmal having @alfredenewman1 (Mayor Pete of Indiana’s most unsuccessful city, by far!) on more than Republicans. Many great alternatives are forming &amp; exist. Try @OANN &amp; @newsmax, among others!

1327840088731029504 2020-11-14 21:05:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mark, but the Fake News Media will never say it!
1327838908089069568 2020-11-14 21:00:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News Media hardly even discussed the tens of thousands of people that came to D.C. Formed organically, and in many parts of the Country!
1327837956820914178 2020-11-14 20:56:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mollie. The Free and Fair Press is gone in our country. They only write about what they want to write about. SUPPRESSION!
1327836670742450177 2020-11-14 20:51:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Silent Media is the Enemy of the People!!!
1327834542707793921 2020-11-14 20:43:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Radical Left ANTIFA SCUM was easily rebuffed today by the big D.C. MAGA Rally crowd, only to return at night, after 99% of the crowd had left, to assault elderly people and families. Police got there, but late. Mayor is not doing her job!
1327828007311073280 2020-11-14 20:17:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ANTIFA SCUM ran for the hills today when they tried attacking the people at the Trump Rally, because those people aggressively fought back. Antifa waited until tonight, when 99% were gone, to attack innocent #MAGA People. DC Police, get going — do your job and don’t hold back!!!
1327811527123103746 2020-11-14 19:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I look forward to Mayor Giuliani spearheading the legal effort to defend OUR RIGHT to FREE and FAIR ELECTIONS!

1327750127679889409 2020-11-14 15:07:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There is tremendous evidence of wide spread voter fraud in that there is irrefutable proof that our Republican poll watchers and observers were not allowed to be present in poll counting rooms. Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and others. Unconstitutional!

1327717223142731779 2020-11-14 12:57:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They wouldn’t let our Poll Watchers and Observers into the Counting Rooms. We win on that alone!

1327715767916392449 2020-11-14 12:51:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The hand recount taking place in Georgia is a waste of time. They are not showing the matching signatures. Call off the recount until they allow the MATCH. Don’t let the Radical Left Dems STEAL THE ELECTION!
1327708998662025216 2020-11-14 12:24:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hundreds of thousands of people showing their support in D.C. They will not stand for a Rigged and Corrupt Election!

1327638502280925184 2020-11-14 07:44:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I LOVE NEW YORK! As everyone knows, the Trump Administration has produced a great and safe VACCINE far ahead of schedule. Another Administration would have taken five years. The problem is, @NYGovCuomo said that he will delay using it, and other states WANT IT NOW...

1327619653020110850 2020-11-14 06:29:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Consent Decree signed by the Georgia Secretary of State, with the approval of Governor @BrianKempGA, at the urging of @staceyabrams, makes it impossible to check &amp; match signatures on ballots and envelopes, etc. They knew they were going to cheat.

1327438487537246210 2020-11-13 18:29:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow. This is exactly what happened to us. Great courage by judge!
1329150897641951233 2020-11-18 11:54:03 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you @DarrellIssa, so nice!   https://t.co/FlUfzV7pSQ

1329097946776940559 2020-11-18 08:23:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> FLOYD COUNTY, GEORGIA!   https://t.co/mIZ5rmdkvw
1329093126238203905 2020-11-18 08:04:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Great State of Michigan, with votes being far greater than the number of people who voted, cannot certify the election. The Democrats cheated big time, and got caught. A Republican WIN!
1329087255168708608 2020-11-18 07:41:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In Detroit, there are FAR MORE VOTES THAN PEOPLE. Nothing can be done to cure that giant scam. I win Michigan!
1329086548093014022 2020-11-18 07:38:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The numbers have not improved, it is still 71% out of balance”, stated Wayne County, Michigan,  Canvassers. “There is widespread irregularities in poll numbers.” There are “more votes than people”. The two harassed patriot Canvassers refuse to sign the papers!
1329075487553974275 2020-11-18 06:54:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THEY WOULD’NT LET REPUBLICAN POLL WATCHERS INTO THE COUNTING ROOMS. UNCONSTITUTIONAL!!!
1329069814195871744 2020-11-18 06:31:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Georgia recount is a joke and is being done UNDER PROTEST. Even though thousands of fraudulent votes have been found, the real number is in matching signatures. Governor must open up the unconstitutional Consent Decree and call in the Legislature!
1329065945160175616 2020-11-18 06:16:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They didn’t even allow Republican Observers into the building to watch. A terrible insult to our Constitution!
1329064787142172673 2020-11-18 06:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This was a rigged election. No Republican Poll Watchers allowed, voting machine “glitches” all over the place (meaning they got caught cheating!), voting after election ended, and so much more!
1329060562442067969 2020-11-18 05:55:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wrong! At first they voted against because there were far more VOTES than PEOPLE (Sad!). Then they were threatened, screamed at and viciously harassed, and were FORCED to change their vote, but then REFUSED, as American patriots, to sign the documents. 71% MESS. Don’t Harass!
1329054683441278977 2020-11-18 05:31:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...AND I WON THE ELECTION. VOTER FRAUD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY!
1329050677541281795 2020-11-18 05:15:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Trump votes.
1328900747497525248 2020-11-17 19:20:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Governor Kemp will hopefully see the light before it is too late. Must finally take charge! Two GREAT Senators, who do so much for Georgia and truly love the USA, are in a must win battle with two incompetents who don’t have a clue!
1328886891765182466 2020-11-17 18:24:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Well, it’s really quite simple. You just can’t have more votes than people!
1328886157246156801 2020-11-17 18:22:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> More votes than people, and that is the least of it!!!
1328885313729687553 2020-11-17 18:18:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Flip Michigan back to TRUMP. Detroit, not surprisingly, has tremendous problems!
1328883405837258753 2020-11-17 18:11:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Michigan just refused to certify the election results! Having courage is a beautiful thing. The USA stands proud!

1328856932011167744 2020-11-17 16:25:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The only thing secure about our 2020 Election was that it was virtually impenetrable by foreign powers. On that, the Trump Administration takes great credit. Unfortunately, the Radical Left Democrats, Dominion, and others, were perhaps more successful!
1328853928025403394 2020-11-17 16:14:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THANK YOU!  https://t.co/DrtsiD71i4

1328483862490574849 2020-11-16 15:43:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Big victory moments ago in the State of Nevada. The all Democrat County Commissioner race, on same ballot as President, just thrown out because of large scale voter discrepancy. Clark County officials do not have confidence in their own election security. Major impact!
1328448530504163329 2020-11-16 13:23:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The rate of rejected Mail-In Ballots is 30 X’s lower in Pennsylvania this year than it was in 2016. This is why they kept our poll watchers and observers out of the “SACRED” vote counting rooms!  https://t.co/QPlzfimbd4
1328382287331856384 2020-11-16 08:59:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Georgia won’t let us look at the all important signature match. Without that the recount is MEANINGLESS. Open up unconstitutional Consent Decree, NOW! @BrianKempGA
1328370030678044675 2020-11-16 08:11:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> European Countries are sadly getting clobbered by the China Virus. The Fake News does not like reporting this!

1328349382023000064 2020-11-16 06:49:06 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Who will be running for Governor of the Great State of Ohio? Will be hotly contested!
1328341927641681922 2020-11-16 06:19:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Another Vaccine just announced. This time by Moderna, 95% effective. For those great “historians”, please remember that these great discoveries, which will end the China Plague, all took place on my watch!
1328338630679597056 2020-11-16 06:06:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Try watching @OANN. Really GREAT!
1328338241284616193 2020-11-16 06:04:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake recount going on in Georgia means nothing because they are not allowing signatures to be looked at and verified. Break the unconstitutional Consent Decree!
1328334945148952576 2020-11-16 05:51:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I won the Election!
1328330303103000577 2020-11-16 05:33:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I strongly stand with Kelly &amp; David. They are both great and MUST WIN!
1328328547598000130 2020-11-16 05:26:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Dominion is running our Election. Rigged!
1328328019807776768 2020-11-16 05:24:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Andrew!
1328324377168015360 2020-11-16 05:09:45 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Washington Post forgot to read the complaint. Fake News. Poll Watchers, and the way they were treated, are a very big deal in the complaint!
1328200072987893762 2020-11-15 20:55:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I WON THE ELECTION!
1328152466752491526 2020-11-15 17:46:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....owned Dominion Voting Systems, turned down by Texas and many others because it was not good or secure, those responsible for the safeguarding of our Constitution cannot allow the Fake results of the 2020 Mail-In Election to stand. The World is watching!
1328152465016020993 2020-11-15 17:46:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....perhaps like never before! From large numbers of Poll Watchers that were thrown out of vote counting rooms in many of our States, to millions of ballots that have been altered by Democrats, only for Democrats, to voting after the Election was over, to using Radical Left
1328152462331699202 2020-11-15 17:46:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why does the Fake News Media continuously assume that Joe Biden will ascend to the Presidency, not even allowing our side to show, which we are just getting ready to do, how badly shattered and violated our great Constitution has been in the 2020 Election. It was attacked,..
1328137498069970947 2020-11-15 16:47:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A great launch! @NASA was a closed up disaster when we took over. Now it is again the “hottest”, most advanced, space center in the world, by far!
1328100945570500608 2020-11-15 14:21:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Many of the court cases being filed all over the Country are not ours, but rather those of people that have seen horrible abuses. Our big cases showing the unconstitutionality of the 2020 Election, &amp; the outrage of things that were done to change the outcome, will soon be filed!
1328094310294822917 2020-11-15 13:55:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Spirit like never before!

1328055196904251397 2020-11-15 11:20:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> John Bolton was one of the dumbest people in government that I’ve had the “pleasure” to work with. A sullen, dull and quiet guy, he added nothing to National Security except, “Gee, let’s go to war.” Also, illegally released much Classified Information. A real dope!

1327979630477922304 2020-11-15 06:19:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!
1327978710809661440 2020-11-15 06:16:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> RIGGED ELECTION. WE WILL WIN!
1327960545929072645 2020-11-15 05:04:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Watch @RudyGiuliani interview on @MariaBartiromo this morning at 10:00. Doing a great job exposing the Rigged Election Hoax!
1327958640309972992 2020-11-15 04:56:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> All of the mechanical “glitches” that took place on Election Night were really THEM getting caught trying to steal votes. They succeeded plenty, however, without getting caught. Mail-in elections are a sick joke!
1327956491056279552 2020-11-15 04:47:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He won because the Election was Rigged. NO VOTE WATCHERS OR OBSERVERS allowed, vote tabulated by a Radical Left privately owned company, Dominion, with a bad reputation &amp; bum equipment that couldn’t even qualify for Texas (which I won by a lot!), the Fake &amp; Silent Media, &amp; more!
1327950785959915520 2020-11-15 04:25:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is why @FoxNews daytime and weekend daytime have lost their ratings. They are abysmal having @alfredenewman1 (Mayor Pete of Indiana’s most unsuccessful city, by far!) on more than Republicans. Many great alternatives are forming &amp; exist. Try @OANN &amp; @newsmax, among others!

1327838908089069568 2020-11-14 21:00:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News Media hardly even discussed the tens of thousands of people that came to D.C. Formed organically, and in many parts of the Country!
1327837956820914178 2020-11-14 20:56:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mollie. The Free and Fair Press is gone in our country. They only write about what they want to write about. SUPPRESSION!
1327836670742450177 2020-11-14 20:51:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Silent Media is the Enemy of the People!!!
1327834542707793921 2020-11-14 20:43:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Radical Left ANTIFA SCUM was easily rebuffed today by the big D.C. MAGA Rally crowd, only to return at night, after 99% of the crowd had left, to assault elderly people and families. Police got there, but late. Mayor is not doing her job!
1327828007311073280 2020-11-14 20:17:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ANTIFA SCUM ran for the hills today when they tried attacking the people at the Trump Rally, because those people aggressively fought back. Antifa waited until tonight, when 99% were gone, to attack innocent #MAGA People. DC Police, get going — do your job and don’t hold back!!!
1327811527123103746 2020-11-14 19:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I look forward to Mayor Giuliani spearheading the legal effort to defend OUR RIGHT to FREE and FAIR ELECTIONS!

1327750127679889409 2020-11-14 15:07:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There is tremendous evidence of wide spread voter fraud in that there is irrefutable proof that our Republican poll watchers and observers were not allowed to be present in poll counting rooms. Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and others. Unconstitutional!

1327717223142731779 2020-11-14 12:57:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They wouldn’t let our Poll Watchers and Observers into the Counting Rooms. We win on that alone!

1327715767916392449 2020-11-14 12:51:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The hand recount taking place in Georgia is a waste of time. They are not showing the matching signatures. Call off the recount until they allow the MATCH. Don’t let the Radical Left Dems STEAL THE ELECTION!
1327708998662025216 2020-11-14 12:24:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hundreds of thousands of people showing their support in D.C. They will not stand for a Rigged and Corrupt Election!
1327707126375051267 2020-11-14 12:17:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We will WIN!
1327704841964183552 2020-11-14 12:07:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> People are not going to stand for having this Election stolen from them by a privately owned Radical Left company, Dominion, and many other reasons!

1327638502280925184 2020-11-14 07:44:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I LOVE NEW YORK! As everyone knows, the Trump Administration has produced a great and safe VACCINE far ahead of schedule. Another Administration would have taken five years. The problem is, @NYGovCuomo said that he will delay using it, and other states WANT IT NOW...

1327633164823617548 2020-11-14 07:23:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congress must now do a Covid Relief Bill. Needs Democrats support. Make it big and focused. Get it done!
1327619654592892931 2020-11-14 06:29:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....What are they trying to hide. They know, and so does everyone else. EXPOSE THE CRIME!
1327619653020110850 2020-11-14 06:29:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Consent Decree signed by the Georgia Secretary of State, with the approval of Governor @BrianKempGA, at the urging of @staceyabrams, makes it impossible to check &amp; match signatures on ballots and envelopes, etc. They knew they were going to cheat. Must expose real signatures!

1327438487537246210 2020-11-13 18:29:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow. This is exactly what happened to us. Great courage by judge!

1329093126238203905 2020-11-18 08:04:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Great State of Michigan, with votes being far greater than the number of people who voted, cannot certify the election. The Democrats cheated big time, and got caught. A Republican WIN!
1329087255168708608 2020-11-18 07:41:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In Detroit, there are FAR MORE VOTES THAN PEOPLE. Nothing can be done to cure that giant scam. I win Michigan!
1329086548093014022 2020-11-18 07:38:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The numbers have not improved, it is still 71% out of balance”, stated Wayne County, Michigan,  Canvassers. “There is widespread irregularities in poll numbers.” There are “more votes than people”. The two harassed patriot Canvassers refuse to sign the papers!
1329075487553974275 2020-11-18 06:54:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THEY WOULD’NT LET REPUBLICAN POLL WATCHERS INTO THE COUNTING ROOMS. UNCONSTITUTIONAL!!!
1329069814195871744 2020-11-18 06:31:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Georgia recount is a joke and is being done UNDER PROTEST. Even though thousands of fraudulent votes have been found, the real number is in matching signatures. Governor must open up the unconstitutional Consent Decree and call in the Legislature!
1329065945160175616 2020-11-18 06:16:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They didn’t even allow Republican Observers into the building to watch. A terrible insult to our Constitution!
1329064787142172673 2020-11-18 06:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This was a rigged election. No Republican Poll Watchers allowed, voting machine “glitches” all over the place (meaning they got caught cheating!), voting after election ended, and so much more!
1329060562442067969 2020-11-18 05:55:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wrong! At first they voted against because there were far more VOTES than PEOPLE (Sad!). Then they were threatened, screamed at and viciously harassed, and were FORCED to change their vote, but then REFUSED, as American patriots, to sign the documents. 71% MESS. Don’t Harass!
1329054683441278977 2020-11-18 05:31:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...AND I WON THE ELECTION. VOTER FRAUD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY!

1328900747497525248 2020-11-17 19:20:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Governor Kemp will hopefully see the light before it is too late. Must finally take charge! Two GREAT Senators, who do so much for Georgia and truly love the USA, are in a must win battle with two incompetents who don’t have a clue!
1328886891765182466 2020-11-17 18:24:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Well, it’s really quite simple. You just can’t have more votes than people!
1328886157246156801 2020-11-17 18:22:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> More votes than people, and that is the least of it!!!
1328885313729687553 2020-11-17 18:18:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Flip Michigan back to TRUMP. Detroit, not surprisingly, has tremendous problems!
1328883405837258753 2020-11-17 18:11:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Michigan just refused to certify the election results! Having courage is a beautiful thing. The USA stands proud!

1328856932011167744 2020-11-17 16:25:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The only thing secure about our 2020 Election was that it was virtually impenetrable by foreign powers. On that, the Trump Administration takes great credit. Unfortunately, the Radical Left Democrats, Dominion, and others, were perhaps more successful!

1328483862490574849 2020-11-16 15:43:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Big victory moments ago in the State of Nevada. The all Democrat County Commissioner race, on same ballot as President, just thrown out because of large scale voter discrepancy. Clark County officials do not have confidence in their own election security. Major impact!
1328448530504163329 2020-11-16 13:23:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The rate of rejected Mail-In Ballots is 30 X’s lower in Pennsylvania this year than it was in 2016. This is why they kept our poll watchers and observers out of the “SACRED” vote counting rooms!  https://t.co/QPlzfimbd4
1328382287331856384 2020-11-16 08:59:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Georgia won’t let us look at the all important signature match. Without that the recount is MEANINGLESS. Open up unconstitutional Consent Decree, NOW! @BrianKempGA

1328338241284616193 2020-11-16 06:04:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake recount going on in Georgia means nothing because they are not allowing signatures to be looked at and verified. Break the unconstitutional Consent Decree!

1328324377168015360 2020-11-16 05:09:45 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Washington Post forgot to read the complaint. Fake News. Poll Watchers, and the way they were treated, are a very big deal in the complaint!
1328200072987893762 2020-11-15 20:55:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I WON THE ELECTION!
1328152466752491526 2020-11-15 17:46:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....owned Dominion Voting Systems, turned down by Texas and many others because it was not good or secure, those responsible for the safeguarding of our Constitution cannot allow the Fake results of the 2020 Mail-In Election to stand. The World is watching!
1328152465016020993 2020-11-15 17:46:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....perhaps like never before! From large numbers of Poll Watchers that were thrown out of vote counting rooms in many of our States, to millions of ballots that have been altered by Democrats, only for Democrats, to voting after the Election was over, to using Radical Left
1328152462331699202 2020-11-15 17:46:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why does the Fake News Media continuously assume that Joe Biden will ascend to the Presidency, not even allowing our side to show, which we are just getting ready to do, how badly shattered and violated our great Constitution has been in the 2020 Election. It was attacked,..
1328137498069970947 2020-11-15 16:47:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A great launch! @NASA was a closed up disaster when we took over. Now it is again the “hottest”, most advanced, space center in the world, by far!
1328100945570500608 2020-11-15 14:21:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Many of the court cases being filed all over the Country are not ours, but rather those of people that have seen horrible abuses. Our big cases showing the unconstitutionality of the 2020 Election, &amp; the outrage of things that were done to change the outcome, will soon be filed!

1328055196904251397 2020-11-15 11:20:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> John Bolton was one of the dumbest people in government that I’ve had the “pleasure” to work with. A sullen, dull and quiet guy, he added nothing to National Security except, “Gee, let’s go to war.” Also, illegally released much Classified Information. A real dope!

1327979630477922304 2020-11-15 06:19:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!
1327978710809661440 2020-11-15 06:16:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> RIGGED ELECTION. WE WILL WIN!
1327960545929072645 2020-11-15 05:04:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Watch @RudyGiuliani interview on @MariaBartiromo this morning at 10:00. Doing a great job exposing the Rigged Election Hoax!
1327958640309972992 2020-11-15 04:56:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> All of the mechanical “glitches” that took place on Election Night were really THEM getting caught trying to steal votes. They succeeded plenty, however, without getting caught. Mail-in elections are a sick joke!
1327956491056279552 2020-11-15 04:47:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He won because the Election was Rigged. NO VOTE WATCHERS OR OBSERVERS allowed, vote tabulated by a Radical Left privately owned company, Dominion, with a bad reputation &amp; bum equipment that couldn’t even qualify for Texas (which I won by a lot!), the Fake &amp; Silent Media, &amp; more!
1327950785959915520 2020-11-15 04:25:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is why @FoxNews daytime and weekend daytime have lost their ratings. They are abysmal having @alfredenewman1 (Mayor Pete of Indiana’s most unsuccessful city, by far!) on more than Republicans. Many great alternatives are forming &amp; exist. Try @OANN &amp; @newsmax, among others!

1327838908089069568 2020-11-14 21:00:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News Media hardly even discussed the tens of thousands of people that came to D.C. Formed organically, and in many parts of the Country!

1327834542707793921 2020-11-14 20:43:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Radical Left ANTIFA SCUM was easily rebuffed today by the big D.C. MAGA Rally crowd, only to return at night, after 99% of the crowd had left, to assault elderly people and families. Police got there, but late. Mayor is not doing her job!
1327828007311073280 2020-11-14 20:17:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ANTIFA SCUM ran for the hills today when they tried attacking the people at the Trump Rally, because those people aggressively fought back. Antifa waited until tonight, when 99% were gone, to attack innocent #MAGA People. DC Police, get going — do your job and don’t hold back!!!
1327811527123103746 2020-11-14 19:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I look forward to Mayor Giuliani spearheading the legal effort to defend OUR RIGHT to FREE and FAIR ELECTIONS!

1327750127679889409 2020-11-14 15:07:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There is tremendous evidence of wide spread voter fraud in that there is irrefutable proof that our Republican poll watchers and observers were not allowed to be present in poll counting rooms. Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and others. Unconstitutional!

1327717223142731779 2020-11-14 12:57:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They wouldn’t let our Poll Watchers and Observers into the Counting Rooms. We win on that alone!

1327715767916392449 2020-11-14 12:51:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The hand recount taking place in Georgia is a waste of time. They are not showing the matching signatures. Call off the recount until they allow the MATCH. Don’t let the Radical Left Dems STEAL THE ELECTION!
1327708998662025216 2020-11-14 12:24:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hundreds of thousands of people showing their support in D.C. They will not stand for a Rigged and Corrupt Election!

1327638502280925184 2020-11-14 07:44:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I LOVE NEW YORK! As everyone knows, the Trump Administration has produced a great and safe VACCINE far ahead of schedule. Another Administration would have taken five years. The problem is, @NYGovCuomo said that he will delay using it, and other states WANT IT NOW...

1327619654592892931 2020-11-14 06:29:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....What are they trying to hide. They know, and so does everyone else. EXPOSE THE CRIME!
1327619653020110850 2020-11-14 06:29:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Consent Decree signed by the Georgia Secretary of State, with the approval of Governor @BrianKempGA, at the urging of @staceyabrams, makes it impossible to check &amp; match signatures on ballots and envelopes, etc. They knew they were going to cheat. Must expose real signatures!

1327438487537246210 2020-11-13 18:29:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow. This is exactly what happened to us. Great courage by judge!

1329097946776940559 2020-11-18 08:23:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> FLOYD COUNTY, GEORGIA!   https://t.co/mIZ5rmdkvw
1329093126238203905 2020-11-18 08:04:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Great State of Michigan, with votes being far greater than the number of people who voted, cannot certify the election. The Democrats cheated big time, and got caught. A Republican WIN!
1329087255168708608 2020-11-18 07:41:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In Detroit, there are FAR MORE VOTES THAN PEOPLE. Nothing can be done to cure that giant scam. I win Michigan!
1329086548093014022 2020-11-18 07:38:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The numbers have not improved, it is still 71% out of balance”, stated Wayne County, Michigan,  Canvassers. “There is widespread irregularities in poll numbers.” There are “more votes than people”. The two harassed patriot Canvassers refuse to sign the papers!
1329075487553974275 2020-11-18 06:54:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THEY WOULD’NT LET REPUBLICAN POLL WATCHERS INTO THE COUNTING ROOMS. UNCONSTITUTIONAL!!!
1329069814195871744 2020-11-18 06:31:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Georgia recount is a joke and is being done UNDER PROTEST. Even though thousands of fraudulent votes have been found, the real number is in matching signatures. Governor must open up the unconstitutional Consent Decree and call in the Legislature!
1329065945160175616 2020-11-18 06:16:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They didn’t even allow Republican Observers into the building to watch. A terrible insult to our Constitution!
1329064787142172673 2020-11-18 06:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This was a rigged election. No Republican Poll Watchers allowed, voting machine “glitches” all over the place (meaning they got caught cheating!), voting after election ended, and so much more!
1329060562442067969 2020-11-18 05:55:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wrong! At first they voted against because there were far more VOTES than PEOPLE (Sad!). Then they were threatened, screamed at and viciously harassed, and were FORCED to change their vote, but then REFUSED, as American patriots, to sign the documents. 71% MESS. Don’t Harass!
1329054683441278977 2020-11-18 05:31:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...AND I WON THE ELECTION. VOTER FRAUD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY!
1329050677541281795 2020-11-18 05:15:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Trump votes.
1328900747497525248 2020-11-17 19:20:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Governor Kemp will hopefully see the light before it is too late. Must finally take charge! Two GREAT Senators, who do so much for Georgia and truly love the USA, are in a must win battle with two incompetents who don’t have a clue!
1328886891765182466 2020-11-17 18:24:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Well, it’s really quite simple. You just can’t have more votes than people!
1328886157246156801 2020-11-17 18:22:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> More votes than people, and that is the least of it!!!
1328885313729687553 2020-11-17 18:18:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Flip Michigan back to TRUMP. Detroit, not surprisingly, has tremendous problems!
1328883405837258753 2020-11-17 18:11:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Michigan just refused to certify the election results! Having courage is a beautiful thing. The USA stands proud!

1328856932011167744 2020-11-17 16:25:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The only thing secure about our 2020 Election was that it was virtually impenetrable by foreign powers. On that, the Trump Administration takes great credit. Unfortunately, the Radical Left Democrats, Dominion, and others, were perhaps more successful!
1328853928025403394 2020-11-17 16:14:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THANK YOU!  https://t.co/DrtsiD71i4

1328483862490574849 2020-11-16 15:43:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Big victory moments ago in the State of Nevada. The all Democrat County Commissioner race, on same ballot as President, just thrown out because of large scale voter discrepancy. Clark County officials do not have confidence in their own election security. Major impact!
1328448530504163329 2020-11-16 13:23:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The rate of rejected Mail-In Ballots is 30 X’s lower in Pennsylvania this year than it was in 2016. This is why they kept our poll watchers and observers out of the “SACRED” vote counting rooms!  https://t.co/QPlzfimbd4
1328382287331856384 2020-11-16 08:59:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Georgia won’t let us look at the all important signature match. Without that the recount is MEANINGLESS. Open up unconstitutional Consent Decree, NOW! @BrianKempGA

1328349382023000064 2020-11-16 06:49:06 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Who will be running for Governor of the Great State of Ohio? Will be hotly contested!
1328341927641681922 2020-11-16 06:19:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Another Vaccine just announced. This time by Moderna, 95% effective. For those great “historians”, please remember that these great discoveries, which will end the China Plague, all took place on my watch!
1328338630679597056 2020-11-16 06:06:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Try watching @OANN. Really GREAT!
1328338241284616193 2020-11-16 06:04:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake recount going on in Georgia means nothing because they are not allowing signatures to be looked at and verified. Break the unconstitutional Consent Decree!
1328334945148952576 2020-11-16 05:51:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I won the Election!

1328324377168015360 2020-11-16 05:09:45 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Washington Post forgot to read the complaint. Fake News. Poll Watchers, and the way they were treated, are a very big deal in the complaint!
1328200072987893762 2020-11-15 20:55:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I WON THE ELECTION!
1328152466752491526 2020-11-15 17:46:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....owned Dominion Voting Systems, turned down by Texas and many others because it was not good or secure, those responsible for the safeguarding of our Constitution cannot allow the Fake results of the 2020 Mail-In Election to stand. The World is watching!
1328152465016020993 2020-11-15 17:46:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....perhaps like never before! From large numbers of Poll Watchers that were thrown out of vote counting rooms in many of our States, to millions of ballots that have been altered by Democrats, only for Democrats, to voting after the Election was over, to using Radical Left
1328152462331699202 2020-11-15 17:46:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why does the Fake News Media continuously assume that Joe Biden will ascend to the Presidency, not even allowing our side to show, which we are just getting ready to do, how badly shattered and violated our great Constitution has been in the 2020 Election. It was attacked,..
1328137498069970947 2020-11-15 16:47:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A great launch! @NASA was a closed up disaster when we took over. Now it is again the “hottest”, most advanced, space center in the world, by far!
1328100945570500608 2020-11-15 14:21:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Many of the court cases being filed all over the Country are not ours, but rather those of people that have seen horrible abuses. Our big cases showing the unconstitutionality of the 2020 Election, &amp; the outrage of things that were done to change the outcome, will soon be filed!

1328055196904251397 2020-11-15 11:20:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> John Bolton was one of the dumbest people in government that I’ve had the “pleasure” to work with. A sullen, dull and quiet guy, he added nothing to National Security except, “Gee, let’s go to war.” Also, illegally released much Classified Information. A real dope!

1327979630477922304 2020-11-15 06:19:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!
1327978710809661440 2020-11-15 06:16:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> RIGGED ELECTION. WE WILL WIN!
1327960545929072645 2020-11-15 05:04:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Watch @RudyGiuliani interview on @MariaBartiromo this morning at 10:00. Doing a great job exposing the Rigged Election Hoax!
1327958640309972992 2020-11-15 04:56:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> All of the mechanical “glitches” that took place on Election Night were really THEM getting caught trying to steal votes. They succeeded plenty, however, without getting caught. Mail-in elections are a sick joke!
1327956491056279552 2020-11-15 04:47:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He won because the Election was Rigged. NO VOTE WATCHERS OR OBSERVERS allowed, vote tabulated by a Radical Left privately owned company, Dominion, with a bad reputation &amp; bum equipment that couldn’t even qualify for Texas (which I won by a lot!), the Fake &amp; Silent Media, &amp; more!
1327950785959915520 2020-11-15 04:25:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is why @FoxNews daytime and weekend daytime have lost their ratings. They are abysmal having @alfredenewman1 (Mayor Pete of Indiana’s most unsuccessful city, by far!) on more than Republicans. Many great alternatives are forming &amp; exist. Try @OANN &amp; @newsmax, among others!

1327838908089069568 2020-11-14 21:00:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News Media hardly even discussed the tens of thousands of people that came to D.C. Formed organically, and in many parts of the Country!
1327837956820914178 2020-11-14 20:56:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mollie. The Free and Fair Press is gone in our country. They only write about what they want to write about. SUPPRESSION!

1327834542707793921 2020-11-14 20:43:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Radical Left ANTIFA SCUM was easily rebuffed today by the big D.C. MAGA Rally crowd, only to return at night, after 99% of the crowd had left, to assault elderly people and families. Police got there, but late. Mayor is not doing her job!
1327828007311073280 2020-11-14 20:17:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ANTIFA SCUM ran for the hills today when they tried attacking the people at the Trump Rally, because those people aggressively fought back. Antifa waited until tonight, when 99% were gone, to attack innocent #MAGA People. DC Police, get going — do your job and don’t hold back!!!
1327811527123103746 2020-11-14 19:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I look forward to Mayor Giuliani spearheading the legal effort to defend OUR RIGHT to FREE and FAIR ELECTIONS!

1327750127679889409 2020-11-14 15:07:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There is tremendous evidence of wide spread voter fraud in that there is irrefutable proof that our Republican poll watchers and observers were not allowed to be present in poll counting rooms. Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and others. Unconstitutional!

1327717223142731779 2020-11-14 12:57:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They wouldn’t let our Poll Watchers and Observers into the Counting Rooms. We win on that alone!

1327715767916392449 2020-11-14 12:51:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The hand recount taking place in Georgia is a waste of time. They are not showing the matching signatures. Call off the recount until they allow the MATCH. Don’t let the Radical Left Dems STEAL THE ELECTION!
1327708998662025216 2020-11-14 12:24:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hundreds of thousands of people showing their support in D.C. They will not stand for a Rigged and Corrupt Election!

1327638502280925184 2020-11-14 07:44:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I LOVE NEW YORK! As everyone knows, the Trump Administration has produced a great and safe VACCINE far ahead of schedule. Another Administration would have taken five years. The problem is, @NYGovCuomo said that he will delay using it, and other states WANT IT NOW...

1327619654592892931 2020-11-14 06:29:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....What are they trying to hide. They know, and so does everyone else. EXPOSE THE CRIME!
1327619653020110850 2020-11-14 06:29:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Consent Decree signed by the Georgia Secretary of State, with the approval of Governor @BrianKempGA, at the urging of @staceyabrams, makes it impossible to check &amp; match signatures on ballots and envelopes, etc. They knew they were going to cheat. Must expose real signatures!

1327438487537246210 2020-11-13 18:29:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow. This is exactly what happened to us. Great courage by judge!

1329093126238203905 2020-11-18 08:04:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Great State of Michigan, with votes being far greater than the number of people who voted, cannot certify the election. The Democrats cheated big time, and got caught. A Republican WIN!
1329087255168708608 2020-11-18 07:41:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In Detroit, there are FAR MORE VOTES THAN PEOPLE. Nothing can be done to cure that giant scam. I win Michigan!
1329086548093014022 2020-11-18 07:38:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The numbers have not improved, it is still 71% out of balance”, stated Wayne County, Michigan,  Canvassers. “There is widespread irregularities in poll numbers.” There are “more votes than people”. The two harassed patriot Canvassers refuse to sign the papers!
1329075487553974275 2020-11-18 06:54:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THEY WOULD’NT LET REPUBLICAN POLL WATCHERS INTO THE COUNTING ROOMS. UNCONSTITUTIONAL!!!
1329069814195871744 2020-11-18 06:31:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Georgia recount is a joke and is being done UNDER PROTEST. Even though thousands of fraudulent votes have been found, the real number is in matching signatures. Governor must open up the unconstitutional Consent Decree and call in the Legislature!
1329065945160175616 2020-11-18 06:16:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They didn’t even allow Republican Observers into the building to watch. A terrible insult to our Constitution!
1329064787142172673 2020-11-18 06:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This was a rigged election. No Republican Poll Watchers allowed, voting machine “glitches” all over the place (meaning they got caught cheating!), voting after election ended, and so much more!
1329060562442067969 2020-11-18 05:55:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wrong! At first they voted against because there were far more VOTES than PEOPLE (Sad!). Then they were threatened, screamed at and viciously harassed, and were FORCED to change their vote, but then REFUSED, as American patriots, to sign the documents. 71% MESS. Don’t Harass!
1329054683441278977 2020-11-18 05:31:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...AND I WON THE ELECTION. VOTER FRAUD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY!
1329050677541281795 2020-11-18 05:15:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Trump votes.
1328900747497525248 2020-11-17 19:20:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Governor Kemp will hopefully see the light before it is too late. Must finally take charge! Two GREAT Senators, who do so much for Georgia and truly love the USA, are in a must win battle with two incompetents who don’t have a clue!
1328886891765182466 2020-11-17 18:24:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Well, it’s really quite simple. You just can’t have more votes than people!
1328886157246156801 2020-11-17 18:22:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> More votes than people, and that is the least of it!!!
1328885313729687553 2020-11-17 18:18:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Flip Michigan back to TRUMP. Detroit, not surprisingly, has tremendous problems!
1328883405837258753 2020-11-17 18:11:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Michigan just refused to certify the election results! Having courage is a beautiful thing. The USA stands proud!

1328856932011167744 2020-11-17 16:25:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The only thing secure about our 2020 Election was that it was virtually impenetrable by foreign powers. On that, the Trump Administration takes great credit. Unfortunately, the Radical Left Democrats, Dominion, and others, were perhaps more successful!

1328483862490574849 2020-11-16 15:43:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Big victory moments ago in the State of Nevada. The all Democrat County Commissioner race, on same ballot as President, just thrown out because of large scale voter discrepancy. Clark County officials do not have confidence in their own election security. Major impact!
1328448530504163329 2020-11-16 13:23:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The rate of rejected Mail-In Ballots is 30 X’s lower in Pennsylvania this year than it was in 2016. This is why they kept our poll watchers and observers out of the “SACRED” vote counting rooms!  https://t.co/QPlzfimbd4
1328382287331856384 2020-11-16 08:59:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Georgia won’t let us look at the all important signature match. Without that the recount is MEANINGLESS. Open up unconstitutional Consent Decree, NOW! @BrianKempGA

1328338241284616193 2020-11-16 06:04:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake recount going on in Georgia means nothing because they are not allowing signatures to be looked at and verified. Break the unconstitutional Consent Decree!

1328324377168015360 2020-11-16 05:09:45 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Washington Post forgot to read the complaint. Fake News. Poll Watchers, and the way they were treated, are a very big deal in the complaint!
1328200072987893762 2020-11-15 20:55:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I WON THE ELECTION!
1328152466752491526 2020-11-15 17:46:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....owned Dominion Voting Systems, turned down by Texas and many others because it was not good or secure, those responsible for the safeguarding of our Constitution cannot allow the Fake results of the 2020 Mail-In Election to stand. The World is watching!
1328152465016020993 2020-11-15 17:46:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....perhaps like never before! From large numbers of Poll Watchers that were thrown out of vote counting rooms in many of our States, to millions of ballots that have been altered by Democrats, only for Democrats, to voting after the Election was over, to using Radical Left
1328152462331699202 2020-11-15 17:46:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why does the Fake News Media continuously assume that Joe Biden will ascend to the Presidency, not even allowing our side to show, which we are just getting ready to do, how badly shattered and violated our great Constitution has been in the 2020 Election. It was attacked,..
1328137498069970947 2020-11-15 16:47:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A great launch! @NASA was a closed up disaster when we took over. Now it is again the “hottest”, most advanced, space center in the world, by far!
1328100945570500608 2020-11-15 14:21:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Many of the court cases being filed all over the Country are not ours, but rather those of people that have seen horrible abuses. Our big cases showing the unconstitutionality of the 2020 Election, &amp; the outrage of things that were done to change the outcome, will soon be filed!

1328055196904251397 2020-11-15 11:20:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> John Bolton was one of the dumbest people in government that I’ve had the “pleasure” to work with. A sullen, dull and quiet guy, he added nothing to National Security except, “Gee, let’s go to war.” Also, illegally released much Classified Information. A real dope!

1327979630477922304 2020-11-15 06:19:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!
1327978710809661440 2020-11-15 06:16:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> RIGGED ELECTION. WE WILL WIN!
1327960545929072645 2020-11-15 05:04:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Watch @RudyGiuliani interview on @MariaBartiromo this morning at 10:00. Doing a great job exposing the Rigged Election Hoax!
1327958640309972992 2020-11-15 04:56:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> All of the mechanical “glitches” that took place on Election Night were really THEM getting caught trying to steal votes. They succeeded plenty, however, without getting caught. Mail-in elections are a sick joke!
1327956491056279552 2020-11-15 04:47:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He won because the Election was Rigged. NO VOTE WATCHERS OR OBSERVERS allowed, vote tabulated by a Radical Left privately owned company, Dominion, with a bad reputation &amp; bum equipment that couldn’t even qualify for Texas (which I won by a lot!), the Fake &amp; Silent Media, &amp; more!
1327950785959915520 2020-11-15 04:25:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is why @FoxNews daytime and weekend daytime have lost their ratings. They are abysmal having @alfredenewman1 (Mayor Pete of Indiana’s most unsuccessful city, by far!) on more than Republicans. Many great alternatives are forming &amp; exist. Try @OANN &amp; @newsmax, among others!

1327838908089069568 2020-11-14 21:00:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News Media hardly even discussed the tens of thousands of people that came to D.C. Formed organically, and in many parts of the Country!
1327837956820914178 2020-11-14 20:56:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mollie. The Free and Fair Press is gone in our country. They only write about what they want to write about. SUPPRESSION!

1327834542707793921 2020-11-14 20:43:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Radical Left ANTIFA SCUM was easily rebuffed today by the big D.C. MAGA Rally crowd, only to return at night, after 99% of the crowd had left, to assault elderly people and families. Police got there, but late. Mayor is not doing her job!
1327828007311073280 2020-11-14 20:17:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ANTIFA SCUM ran for the hills today when they tried attacking the people at the Trump Rally, because those people aggressively fought back. Antifa waited until tonight, when 99% were gone, to attack innocent #MAGA People. DC Police, get going — do your job and don’t hold back!!!
1327811527123103746 2020-11-14 19:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I look forward to Mayor Giuliani spearheading the legal effort to defend OUR RIGHT to FREE and FAIR ELECTIONS!

1327750127679889409 2020-11-14 15:07:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There is tremendous evidence of wide spread voter fraud in that there is irrefutable proof that our Republican poll watchers and observers were not allowed to be present in poll counting rooms. Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and others. Unconstitutional!

1327715767916392449 2020-11-14 12:51:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The hand recount taking place in Georgia is a waste of time. They are not showing the matching signatures. Call off the recount until they allow the MATCH. Don’t let the Radical Left Dems STEAL THE ELECTION!
1327708998662025216 2020-11-14 12:24:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hundreds of thousands of people showing their support in D.C. They will not stand for a Rigged and Corrupt Election!

1327704841964183552 2020-11-14 12:07:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> People are not going to stand for having this Election stolen from them by a privately owned Radical Left company, Dominion, and many other reasons!

1327638502280925184 2020-11-14 07:44:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I LOVE NEW YORK! As everyone knows, the Trump Administration has produced a great and safe VACCINE far ahead of schedule. Another Administration would have taken five years. The problem is, @NYGovCuomo said that he will delay using it, and other states WANT IT NOW...

1327619654592892931 2020-11-14 06:29:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....What are they trying to hide. They know, and so does everyone else. EXPOSE THE CRIME!
1327619653020110850 2020-11-14 06:29:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Consent Decree signed by the Georgia Secretary of State, with the approval of Governor @BrianKempGA, at the urging of @staceyabrams, makes it impossible to check &amp; match signatures on ballots and envelopes, etc. They knew they were going to cheat. Must expose real signatures!

1327438487537246210 2020-11-13 18:29:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow. This is exactly what happened to us. Great courage by judge!

1329093126238203905 2020-11-18 08:04:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Great State of Michigan, with votes being far greater than the number of people who voted, cannot certify the election. The Democrats cheated big time, and got caught. A Republican WIN!
1329087255168708608 2020-11-18 07:41:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In Detroit, there are FAR MORE VOTES THAN PEOPLE. Nothing can be done to cure that giant scam. I win Michigan!
1329086548093014022 2020-11-18 07:38:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The numbers have not improved, it is still 71% out of balance”, stated Wayne County, Michigan,  Canvassers. “There is widespread irregularities in poll numbers.” There are “more votes than people”. The two harassed patriot Canvassers refuse to sign the papers!
1329075487553974275 2020-11-18 06:54:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THEY WOULD’NT LET REPUBLICAN POLL WATCHERS INTO THE COUNTING ROOMS. UNCONSTITUTIONAL!!!
1329069814195871744 2020-11-18 06:31:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Georgia recount is a joke and is being done UNDER PROTEST. Even though thousands of fraudulent votes have been found, the real number is in matching signatures. Governor must open up the unconstitutional Consent Decree and call in the Legislature!
1329065945160175616 2020-11-18 06:16:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They didn’t even allow Republican Observers into the building to watch. A terrible insult to our Constitution!
1329064787142172673 2020-11-18 06:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This was a rigged election. No Republican Poll Watchers allowed, voting machine “glitches” all over the place (meaning they got caught cheating!), voting after election ended, and so much more!
1329060562442067969 2020-11-18 05:55:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wrong! At first they voted against because there were far more VOTES than PEOPLE (Sad!). Then they were threatened, screamed at and viciously harassed, and were FORCED to change their vote, but then REFUSED, as American patriots, to sign the documents. 71% MESS. Don’t Harass!
1329054683441278977 2020-11-18 05:31:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...AND I WON THE ELECTION. VOTER FRAUD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY!

1328900747497525248 2020-11-17 19:20:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Governor Kemp will hopefully see the light before it is too late. Must finally take charge! Two GREAT Senators, who do so much for Georgia and truly love the USA, are in a must win battle with two incompetents who don’t have a clue!
1328886891765182466 2020-11-17 18:24:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Well, it’s really quite simple. You just can’t have more votes than people!
1328886157246156801 2020-11-17 18:22:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> More votes than people, and that is the least of it!!!
1328885313729687553 2020-11-17 18:18:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Flip Michigan back to TRUMP. Detroit, not surprisingly, has tremendous problems!
1328883405837258753 2020-11-17 18:11:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Michigan just refused to certify the election results! Having courage is a beautiful thing. The USA stands proud!

1328856932011167744 2020-11-17 16:25:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The only thing secure about our 2020 Election was that it was virtually impenetrable by foreign powers. On that, the Trump Administration takes great credit. Unfortunately, the Radical Left Democrats, Dominion, and others, were perhaps more successful!

1328483862490574849 2020-11-16 15:43:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Big victory moments ago in the State of Nevada. The all Democrat County Commissioner race, on same ballot as President, just thrown out because of large scale voter discrepancy. Clark County officials do not have confidence in their own election security. Major impact!
1328448530504163329 2020-11-16 13:23:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The rate of rejected Mail-In Ballots is 30 X’s lower in Pennsylvania this year than it was in 2016. This is why they kept our poll watchers and observers out of the “SACRED” vote counting rooms!  https://t.co/QPlzfimbd4
1328382287331856384 2020-11-16 08:59:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Georgia won’t let us look at the all important signature match. Without that the recount is MEANINGLESS. Open up unconstitutional Consent Decree, NOW! @BrianKempGA

1328338241284616193 2020-11-16 06:04:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake recount going on in Georgia means nothing because they are not allowing signatures to be looked at and verified. Break the unconstitutional Consent Decree!

1328324377168015360 2020-11-16 05:09:45 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Washington Post forgot to read the complaint. Fake News. Poll Watchers, and the way they were treated, are a very big deal in the complaint!
1328200072987893762 2020-11-15 20:55:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I WON THE ELECTION!

The World is watching!
1328152465016020993 2020-11-15 17:46:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....perhaps like never before! From large numbers of Poll Watchers that were thrown out of vote counting rooms in many of our States, to millions of ballots that have been altered by Democrats, only for Democrats, to voting after the Election was over, to using Radical Left
1328152462331699202 2020-11-15 17:46:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why does the Fake News Media continuously assume that Joe Biden will ascend to the Presidency, not even allowing our side to show, which we are just getting ready to do, how badly shattered and violated our great Constitution has been in the 2020 Election. It was attacked,..
1328137498069970947 2020-11-15 16:47:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A great launch! @NASA was a closed up disaster when we took over. Now it is again the “hottest”, most advanced, space center in the world, by far!
1328100945570500608 2020-11-15 14:21:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Many of the court cases being filed all over the Country are not ours, but rather those of people that have seen horrible abuses. Our big cases showing the unconstitutionality of the 2020 Election, &amp; the outrage of things that were done to change the outcome, will soon be filed!

1328055196904251397 2020-11-15 11:20:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> John Bolton was one of the dumbest people in government that I’ve had the “pleasure” to work with.

1327978710809661440 2020-11-15 06:16:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> RIGGED ELECTION. WE WILL WIN!
1327960545929072645 2020-11-15 05:04:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Watch @RudyGiuliani interview on @MariaBartiromo this morning at 10:00. Doing a great job exposing the Rigged Election Hoax!
1327958640309972992 2020-11-15 04:56:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> All of the mechanical “glitches” that took place on Election Night were really THEM getting caught trying to steal votes. They succeeded plenty, however, without getting caught. Mail-in elections are a sick joke!
1327956491056279552 2020-11-15 04:47:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He won because the Election was Rigged. NO VOTE WATCHERS OR OBSERVERS allowed, vote tabulated by a Radical Left privately owned company, Dominion, with a bad reputation &amp; bum equipment that couldn’t even qualify for Texas (which I won by a lot!), the Fake &amp; Silent Media, &amp; more!
1327950785959915520 2020-11-15 04:25:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is why @FoxNews daytime and weekend daytime have lost their ratings. They are abysmal having @alfredenewman1 (Mayor Pete of Indiana’s most unsuccessful city, by far!) on more than Republicans. Many great alternatives are forming &amp; exist. Try @OANN &amp; @newsmax, among others!

1327838908089069568 2020-11-14 21:00:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News Media hardly even discussed the tens of thousands of people that came to D.C. Formed organically, and in many parts of the Country!
1327837956820914178 2020-11-14 20:56:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mollie. The Free and Fair Press is gone in our country. They only write about what they want to write about. SUPPRESSION!

1327834542707793921 2020-11-14 20:43:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Radical Left ANTIFA SCUM was easily rebuffed today by the big D.C. MAGA Rally crowd, only to return at night, after 99% of the crowd had left, to assault elderly people and families. Police got there, but late. Mayor is not doing her job!
1327828007311073280 2020-11-14 20:17:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ANTIFA SCUM ran for the hills today when they tried attacking the people at the Trump Rally, because those people aggressively fought back. Antifa waited until tonight, when 99% were gone, to attack innocent #MAGA People. DC Police, get going — do your job and don’t hold back!!!
1327811527123103746 2020-11-14 19:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I look forward to Mayor Giuliani spearheading the legal effort to defend OUR RIGHT to FREE and FAIR ELECTIONS!

1327750127679889409 2020-11-14 15:07:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There is tremendous evidence of wide spread voter fraud in that there is irrefutable proof that our Republican poll watchers and observers were not allowed to be present in poll counting rooms. Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and others. Unconstitutional!

1327715767916392449 2020-11-14 12:51:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The hand recount taking place in Georgia is a waste of time. They are not showing the matching signatures. Call off the recount until they allow the MATCH. Don’t let the Radical Left Dems STEAL THE ELECTION!
1327708998662025216 2020-11-14 12:24:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hundreds of thousands of people showing their support in D.C. They will not stand for a Rigged and Corrupt Election!
1327707126375051267 2020-11-14 12:17:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We will WIN!
1327704841964183552 2020-11-14 12:07:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> People are not going to stand for having this Election stolen from them by a privately owned Radical Left company, Dominion, and many other reasons!

1327638502280925184 2020-11-14 07:44:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I LOVE NEW YORK! As everyone knows, the Trump Administration has produced a great and safe VACCINE far ahead of schedule. Another Administration would have taken five years. The problem is, @NYGovCuomo said that he will delay using it, and other states WANT IT NOW...

1327633164823617548 2020-11-14 07:23:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congress must now do a Covid Relief Bill. Needs Democrats support. Make it big and focused. Get it done!
1327619654592892931 2020-11-14 06:29:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....What are they trying to hide. They know, and so does everyone else. EXPOSE THE CRIME!
1327619653020110850 2020-11-14 06:29:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Consent Decree signed by the Georgia Secretary of State, with the approval of Governor @BrianKempGA, at the urging of @staceyabrams, makes it impossible to check &amp; match signatures on ballots and envelopes, etc. They knew they were going to cheat. Must expose real signatures!

1327438487537246210 2020-11-13 18:29:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow. This is exactly what happened to us. Great courage by judge!

1329093126238203905 2020-11-18 08:04:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Great State of Michigan, with votes being far greater than the number of people who voted, cannot certify the election. The Democrats cheated big time, and got caught. A Republican WIN!
1329087255168708608 2020-11-18 07:41:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In Detroit, there are FAR MORE VOTES THAN PEOPLE. Nothing can be done to cure that giant scam. I win Michigan!
1329086548093014022 2020-11-18 07:38:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The numbers have not improved, it is still 71% out of balance”, stated Wayne County, Michigan,  Canvassers. “There is widespread irregularities in poll numbers.” There are “more votes than people”. The two harassed patriot Canvassers refuse to sign the papers!
1329075487553974275 2020-11-18 06:54:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THEY WOULD’NT LET REPUBLICAN POLL WATCHERS INTO THE COUNTING ROOMS. UNCONSTITUTIONAL!!!
1329069814195871744 2020-11-18 06:31:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Georgia recount is a joke and is being done UNDER PROTEST. Even though thousands of fraudulent votes have been found, the real number is in matching signatures. Governor must open up the unconstitutional Consent Decree and call in the Legislature!
1329065945160175616 2020-11-18 06:16:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They didn’t even allow Republican Observers into the building to watch. A terrible insult to our Constitution!
1329064787142172673 2020-11-18 06:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This was a rigged election. No Republican Poll Watchers allowed, voting machine “glitches” all over the place (meaning they got caught cheating!), voting after election ended, and so much more!
1329060562442067969 2020-11-18 05:55:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wrong! At first they voted against because there were far more VOTES than PEOPLE (Sad!). Then they were threatened, screamed at and viciously harassed, and were FORCED to change their vote, but then REFUSED, as American patriots, to sign the documents. 71% MESS. Don’t Harass!
1329054683441278977 2020-11-18 05:31:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...AND I WON THE ELECTION. VOTER FRAUD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY!

1328900747497525248 2020-11-17 19:20:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Governor Kemp will hopefully see the light before it is too late. Must finally take charge! Two GREAT Senators, who do so much for Georgia and truly love the USA, are in a must win battle with two incompetents who don’t have a clue!
1328886891765182466 2020-11-17 18:24:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Well, it’s really quite simple. You just can’t have more votes than people!
1328886157246156801 2020-11-17 18:22:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> More votes than people, and that is the least of it!!!
1328885313729687553 2020-11-17 18:18:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Flip Michigan back to TRUMP. Detroit, not surprisingly, has tremendous problems!
1328883405837258753 2020-11-17 18:11:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Michigan just refused to certify the election results! Having courage is a beautiful thing. The USA stands proud!

1328856932011167744 2020-11-17 16:25:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The only thing secure about our 2020 Election was that it was virtually impenetrable by foreign powers. On that, the Trump Administration takes great credit. Unfortunately, the Radical Left Democrats, Dominion, and others, were perhaps more successful!

1328483862490574849 2020-11-16 15:43:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Big victory moments ago in the State of Nevada. The all Democrat County Commissioner race, on same ballot as President, just thrown out because of large scale voter discrepancy. Clark County officials do not have confidence in their own election security. Major impact!
1328448530504163329 2020-11-16 13:23:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The rate of rejected Mail-In Ballots is 30 X’s lower in Pennsylvania this year than it was in 2016. This is why they kept our poll watchers and observers out of the “SACRED” vote counting rooms!  https://t.co/QPlzfimbd4
1328382287331856384 2020-11-16 08:59:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Georgia won’t let us look at the all important signature match. Without that the recount is MEANINGLESS. Open up unconstitutional Consent Decree, NOW! @BrianKempGA

1328338241284616193 2020-11-16 06:04:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake recount going on in Georgia means nothing because they are not allowing signatures to be looked at and verified. Break the unconstitutional Consent Decree!

1328324377168015360 2020-11-16 05:09:45 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Washington Post forgot to read the complaint. Fake News. Poll Watchers, and the way they were treated, are a very big deal in the complaint!
1328200072987893762 2020-11-15 20:55:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I WON THE ELECTION!

The World is watching!
1328152465016020993 2020-11-15 17:46:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....perhaps like never before! From large numbers of Poll Watchers that were thrown out of vote counting rooms in many of our States, to millions of ballots that have been altered by Democrats, only for Democrats, to voting after the Election was over, to using Radical Left
1328152462331699202 2020-11-15 17:46:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why does the Fake News Media continuously assume that Joe Biden will ascend to the Presidency, not even allowing our side to show, which we are just getting ready to do, how badly shattered and violated our great Constitution has been in the 2020 Election. It was attacked,..
1328137498069970947 2020-11-15 16:47:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A great launch! @NASA was a closed up disaster when we took over. Now it is again the “hottest”, most advanced, space center in the world, by far!
1328100945570500608 2020-11-15 14:21:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Many of the court cases being filed all over the Country are not ours, but rather those of people that have seen horrible abuses. Our big cases showing the unconstitutionality of the 2020 Election, &amp; the outrage of things that were done to change the outcome, will soon be filed!

1328055196904251397 2020-11-15 11:20:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> John Bolton was one of the dumbest people in government that I’ve had the “pleasure” to work with.

1327978710809661440 2020-11-15 06:16:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> RIGGED ELECTION. WE WILL WIN!
1327960545929072645 2020-11-15 05:04:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Watch @RudyGiuliani interview on @MariaBartiromo this morning at 10:00. Doing a great job exposing the Rigged Election Hoax!
1327958640309972992 2020-11-15 04:56:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> All of the mechanical “glitches” that took place on Election Night were really THEM getting caught trying to steal votes. They succeeded plenty, however, without getting caught. Mail-in elections are a sick joke!
1327956491056279552 2020-11-15 04:47:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He won because the Election was Rigged. NO VOTE WATCHERS OR OBSERVERS allowed, vote tabulated by a Radical Left privately owned company, Dominion, with a bad reputation &amp; bum equipment that couldn’t even qualify for Texas (which I won by a lot!), the Fake &amp; Silent Media, &amp; more!
1327950785959915520 2020-11-15 04:25:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is why @FoxNews daytime and weekend daytime have lost their ratings. They are abysmal having @alfredenewman1 (Mayor Pete of Indiana’s most unsuccessful city, by far!) on more than Republicans. Many great alternatives are forming &amp; exist. Try @OANN &amp; @newsmax, among others!

1327838908089069568 2020-11-14 21:00:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News Media hardly even discussed the tens of thousands of people that came to D.C. Formed organically, and in many parts of the Country!

1327834542707793921 2020-11-14 20:43:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Radical Left ANTIFA SCUM was easily rebuffed today by the big D.C. MAGA Rally crowd, only to return at night, after 99% of the crowd had left, to assault elderly people and families. Police got there, but late. Mayor is not doing her job!
1327828007311073280 2020-11-14 20:17:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ANTIFA SCUM ran for the hills today when they tried attacking the people at the Trump Rally, because those people aggressively fought back. Antifa waited until tonight, when 99% were gone, to attack innocent #MAGA People. DC Police, get going — do your job and don’t hold back!!!
1327811527123103746 2020-11-14 19:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I look forward to Mayor Giuliani spearheading the legal effort to defend OUR RIGHT to FREE and FAIR ELECTIONS!

1327750127679889409 2020-11-14 15:07:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There is tremendous evidence of wide spread voter fraud in that there is irrefutable proof that our Republican poll watchers and observers were not allowed to be present in poll counting rooms. Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and others. Unconstitutional!

1327717223142731779 2020-11-14 12:57:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They wouldn’t let our Poll Watchers and Observers into the Counting Rooms. We win on that alone!

1327715767916392449 2020-11-14 12:51:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The hand recount taking place in Georgia is a waste of time. They are not showing the matching signatures. Call off the recount until they allow the MATCH. Don’t let the Radical Left Dems STEAL THE ELECTION!
1327708998662025216 2020-11-14 12:24:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hundreds of thousands of people showing their support in D.C. They will not stand for a Rigged and Corrupt Election!
1327707126375051267 2020-11-14 12:17:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We will WIN!
1327704841964183552 2020-11-14 12:07:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> People are not going to stand for having this Election stolen from them by a privately owned Radical Left company, Dominion, and many other reasons!

1327638503883235332 2020-11-14 07:44:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....We cannot waste time and can only give to those states that will use the Vaccine immediately. Therefore the New York delay. Many lives to be saved, but we are ready when they are. Stop playing politics!
1327638502280925184 2020-11-14 07:44:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I LOVE NEW YORK! As everyone knows, the Trump Administration has produced a great and safe VACCINE far ahead of schedule. Another Administration would have taken five years. The problem is, @NYGovCuomo said that he will delay using it, and other states WANT IT NOW...

1327633164823617548 2020-11-14 07:23:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congress must now do a Covid Relief Bill. Needs Democrats support. Make it big and focused. Get it done!
1327619654592892931 2020-11-14 06:29:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....What are they trying to hide. They know, and so does everyone else. EXPOSE THE CRIME!
1327619653020110850 2020-11-14 06:29:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Consent Decree signed by the Georgia Secretary of State, with the approval of Governor @BrianKempGA, at the urging of @staceyabrams, makes it impossible to check &amp; match signatures on ballots and envelopes, etc. They knew they were going to cheat. Must expose real signatures!

1327438487537246210 2020-11-13 18:29:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow. This is exactly what happened to us. Great courage by judge!

1329093126238203905 2020-11-18 08:04:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Great State of Michigan, with votes being far greater than the number of people who voted, cannot certify the election. The Democrats cheated big time, and got caught. A Republican WIN!
1329087255168708608 2020-11-18 07:41:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In Detroit, there are FAR MORE VOTES THAN PEOPLE. Nothing can be done to cure that giant scam. I win Michigan!
1329086548093014022 2020-11-18 07:38:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The numbers have not improved, it is still 71% out of balance”, stated Wayne County, Michigan,  Canvassers. “There is widespread irregularities in poll numbers.” There are “more votes than people”. The two harassed patriot Canvassers refuse to sign the papers!
1329075487553974275 2020-11-18 06:54:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THEY WOULD’NT LET REPUBLICAN POLL WATCHERS INTO THE COUNTING ROOMS. UNCONSTITUTIONAL!!!
1329069814195871744 2020-11-18 06:31:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Georgia recount is a joke and is being done UNDER PROTEST. Even though thousands of fraudulent votes have been found, the real number is in matching signatures. Governor must open up the unconstitutional Consent Decree and call in the Legislature!
1329065945160175616 2020-11-18 06:16:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They didn’t even allow Republican Observers into the building to watch. A terrible insult to our Constitution!
1329064787142172673 2020-11-18 06:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This was a rigged election. No Republican Poll Watchers allowed, voting machine “glitches” all over the place (meaning they got caught cheating!), voting after election ended, and so much more!
1329060562442067969 2020-11-18 05:55:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wrong! At first they voted against because there were far more VOTES than PEOPLE (Sad!). Then they were threatened, screamed at and viciously harassed, and were FORCED to change their vote, but then REFUSED, as American patriots, to sign the documents. 71% MESS. Don’t Harass!
1329054683441278977 2020-11-18 05:31:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...AND I WON THE ELECTION. VOTER FRAUD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY!
1329050677541281795 2020-11-18 05:15:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Trump votes.
1328900747497525248 2020-11-17 19:20:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Governor Kemp will hopefully see the light before it is too late. Must finally take charge! Two GREAT Senators, who do so much for Georgia and truly love the USA, are in a must win battle with two incompetents who don’t have a clue!
1328886891765182466 2020-11-17 18:24:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Well, it’s really quite simple. You just can’t have more votes than people!
1328886157246156801 2020-11-17 18:22:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> More votes than people, and that is the least of it!!!
1328885313729687553 2020-11-17 18:18:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Flip Michigan back to TRUMP. Detroit, not surprisingly, has tremendous problems!
1328883405837258753 2020-11-17 18:11:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Michigan just refused to certify the election results! Having courage is a beautiful thing. The USA stands proud!

1328856932011167744 2020-11-17 16:25:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The only thing secure about our 2020 Election was that it was virtually impenetrable by foreign powers. On that, the Trump Administration takes great credit. Unfortunately, the Radical Left Democrats, Dominion, and others, were perhaps more successful!
1328853928025403394 2020-11-17 16:14:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THANK YOU!  https://t.co/DrtsiD71i4

1328483862490574849 2020-11-16 15:43:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Big victory moments ago in the State of Nevada. The all Democrat County Commissioner race, on same ballot as President, just thrown out because of large scale voter discrepancy. Clark County officials do not have confidence in their own election security. Major impact!
1328448530504163329 2020-11-16 13:23:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The rate of rejected Mail-In Ballots is 30 X’s lower in Pennsylvania this year than it was in 2016. This is why they kept our poll watchers and observers out of the “SACRED” vote counting rooms!  https://t.co/QPlzfimbd4
1328382287331856384 2020-11-16 08:59:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Georgia won’t let us look at the all important signature match. Without that the recount is MEANINGLESS. Open up unconstitutional Consent Decree, NOW! @BrianKempGA

1328338241284616193 2020-11-16 06:04:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake recount going on in Georgia means nothing because they are not allowing signatures to be looked at and verified. Break the unconstitutional Consent Decree!
1328334945148952576 2020-11-16 05:51:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I won the Election!

1328324377168015360 2020-11-16 05:09:45 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Washington Post forgot to read the complaint. Fake News. Poll Watchers, and the way they were treated, are a very big deal in the complaint!
1328200072987893762 2020-11-15 20:55:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I WON THE ELECTION!
1328152466752491526 2020-11-15 17:46:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....owned Dominion Voting Systems, turned down by Texas and many others because it was not good or secure, those responsible for the safeguarding of our Constitution cannot allow the Fake results of the 2020 Mail-In Election to stand. The World is watching!
1328152465016020993 2020-11-15 17:46:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....perhaps like never before! From large numbers of Poll Watchers that were thrown out of vote counting rooms in many of our States, to millions of ballots that have been altered by Democrats, only for Democrats, to voting after the Election was over, to using Radical Left
1328152462331699202 2020-11-15 17:46:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why does the Fake News Media continuously assume that Joe Biden will ascend to the Presidency, not even allowing our side to show, which we are just getting ready to do, how badly shattered and violated our great Constitution has been in the 2020 Election. It was attacked,..
1328137498069970947 2020-11-15 16:47:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A great launch! @NASA was a closed up disaster when we took over. Now it is again the “hottest”, most advanced, space center in the world, by far!
1328100945570500608 2020-11-15 14:21:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Many of the court cases being filed all over the Country are not ours, but rather those of people that have seen horrible abuses. Our big cases showing the unconstitutionality of the 2020 Election, &amp; the outrage of things that were done to change the outcome, will soon be filed!

1328055196904251397 2020-11-15 11:20:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> John Bolton was one of the dumbest people in government that I’ve had the “pleasure” to work with. A sullen, dull and quiet guy, he added nothing to National Security except, “Gee, let’s go to war.” Also, illegally released much Classified Information. A real dope!

1327979630477922304 2020-11-15 06:19:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!
1327978710809661440 2020-11-15 06:16:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> RIGGED ELECTION. WE WILL WIN!
1327960545929072645 2020-11-15 05:04:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Watch @RudyGiuliani interview on @MariaBartiromo this morning at 10:00. Doing a great job exposing the Rigged Election Hoax!
1327958640309972992 2020-11-15 04:56:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> All of the mechanical “glitches” that took place on Election Night were really THEM getting caught trying to steal votes. They succeeded plenty, however, without getting caught. Mail-in elections are a sick joke!
1327956491056279552 2020-11-15 04:47:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He won because the Election was Rigged. NO VOTE WATCHERS OR OBSERVERS allowed, vote tabulated by a Radical Left privately owned company, Dominion, with a bad reputation &amp; bum equipment that couldn’t even qualify for Texas (which I won by a lot!), the Fake &amp; Silent Media, &amp; more!
1327950785959915520 2020-11-15 04:25:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is why @FoxNews daytime and weekend daytime have lost their ratings. They are abysmal having @alfredenewman1 (Mayor Pete of Indiana’s most unsuccessful city, by far!) on more than Republicans. Many great alternatives are forming &amp; exist. Try @OANN &amp; @newsmax, among others!

1327838908089069568 2020-11-14 21:00:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News Media hardly even discussed the tens of thousands of people that came to D.C. Formed organically, and in many parts of the Country!
1327837956820914178 2020-11-14 20:56:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mollie. The Free and Fair Press is gone in our country. They only write about what they want to write about. SUPPRESSION!
1327836670742450177 2020-11-14 20:51:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Silent Media is the Enemy of the People!!!
1327834542707793921 2020-11-14 20:43:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Radical Left ANTIFA SCUM was easily rebuffed today by the big D.C. MAGA Rally crowd, only to return at night, after 99% of the crowd had left, to assault elderly people and families. Police got there, but late. Mayor is not doing her job!
1327828007311073280 2020-11-14 20:17:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ANTIFA SCUM ran for the hills today when they tried attacking the people at the Trump Rally, because those people aggressively fought back. Antifa waited until tonight, when 99% were gone, to attack innocent #MAGA People. DC Police, get going — do your job and don’t hold back!!!
1327811527123103746 2020-11-14 19:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I look forward to Mayor Giuliani spearheading the legal effort to defend OUR RIGHT to FREE and FAIR ELECTIONS! Rudy Giuliani, Joseph diGenova, Victoria Toensing, Sidney Powell, and Jenna Ellis, a truly great team, added to our other wonderful lawyers and representatives!
1327750127679889409 2020-11-14 15:07:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There is tremendous evidence of wide spread voter fraud in that there is irrefutable proof that our Republican poll watchers and observers were not allowed to be present in poll counting rooms.

1327717223142731779 2020-11-14 12:57:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They wouldn’t let our Poll Watchers and Observers into the Counting Rooms. We win on that alone!

1327715767916392449 2020-11-14 12:51:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The hand recount taking place in Georgia is a waste of time. They are not showing the matching signatures. Call off the recount until they allow the MATCH. Don’t let the Radical Left Dems STEAL THE ELECTION!
1327708998662025216 2020-11-14 12:24:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hundreds of thousands of people showing their support in D.C. They will not stand for a Rigged and Corrupt Election!
1327707126375051267 2020-11-14 12:17:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We will WIN!
1327704841964183552 2020-11-14 12:07:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> People are not going to stand for having this Election stolen from them by a privately owned Radical Left company, Dominion, and many other reasons!

1327638503883235332 2020-11-14 07:44:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....We cannot waste time and can only give to those states that will use the Vaccine immediately. Therefore the New York delay. Many lives to be saved, but we are ready when they are. Stop playing politics!
1327638502280925184 2020-11-14 07:44:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I LOVE NEW YORK! As everyone knows, the Trump Administration has produced a great and safe VACCINE far ahead of schedule. Another Administration would have taken five years. The problem is, @NYGovCuomo said that he will delay using it, and other states WANT IT NOW...

1327619654592892931 2020-11-14 06:29:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....What are they trying to hide. They know, and so does everyone else. EXPOSE THE CRIME!
1327619653020110850 2020-11-14 06:29:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Consent Decree signed by the Georgia Secretary of State, with the approval of Governor @BrianKempGA, at the urging of @staceyabrams, makes it impossible to check &amp; match signatures on ballots and envelopes, etc. They knew they were going to cheat. Must expose real signatures!

1327438487537246210 2020-11-13 18:29:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow. This is exactly what happened to us. Great courage by judge!

1329093126238203905 2020-11-18 08:04:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Great State of Michigan, with votes being far greater than the number of people who voted, cannot certify the election. The Democrats cheated big time, and got caught. A Republican WIN!
1329087255168708608 2020-11-18 07:41:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In Detroit, there are FAR MORE VOTES THAN PEOPLE. Nothing can be done to cure that giant scam. I win Michigan!
1329086548093014022 2020-11-18 07:38:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The numbers have not improved, it is still 71% out of balance”, stated Wayne County, Michigan,  Canvassers. “There is widespread irregularities in poll numbers.” There are “more votes than people”. The two harassed patriot Canvassers refuse to sign the papers!
1329075487553974275 2020-11-18 06:54:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THEY WOULD’NT LET REPUBLICAN POLL WATCHERS INTO THE COUNTING ROOMS. UNCONSTITUTIONAL!!!
1329069814195871744 2020-11-18 06:31:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Georgia recount is a joke and is being done UNDER PROTEST. Even though thousands of fraudulent votes have been found, the real number is in matching signatures. Governor must open up the unconstitutional Consent Decree and call in the Legislature!
1329065945160175616 2020-11-18 06:16:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They didn’t even allow Republican Observers into the building to watch. A terrible insult to our Constitution!
1329064787142172673 2020-11-18 06:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This was a rigged election. No Republican Poll Watchers allowed, voting machine “glitches” all over the place (meaning they got caught cheating!), voting after election ended, and so much more!
1329060562442067969 2020-11-18 05:55:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wrong! At first they voted against because there were far more VOTES than PEOPLE (Sad!). Then they were threatened, screamed at and viciously harassed, and were FORCED to change their vote, but then REFUSED, as American patriots, to sign the documents. 71% MESS. Don’t Harass!
1329054683441278977 2020-11-18 05:31:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...AND I WON THE ELECTION. VOTER FRAUD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY!

1328900747497525248 2020-11-17 19:20:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Governor Kemp will hopefully see the light before it is too late. Must finally take charge! Two GREAT Senators, who do so much for Georgia and truly love the USA, are in a must win battle with two incompetents who don’t have a clue!
1328886891765182466 2020-11-17 18:24:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Well, it’s really quite simple. You just can’t have more votes than people!
1328886157246156801 2020-11-17 18:22:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> More votes than people, and that is the least of it!!!
1328885313729687553 2020-11-17 18:18:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Flip Michigan back to TRUMP. Detroit, not surprisingly, has tremendous problems!
1328883405837258753 2020-11-17 18:11:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Michigan just refused to certify the election results! Having courage is a beautiful thing. The USA stands proud!

1328856932011167744 2020-11-17 16:25:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The only thing secure about our 2020 Election was that it was virtually impenetrable by foreign powers. On that, the Trump Administration takes great credit. Unfortunately, the Radical Left Democrats, Dominion, and others, were perhaps more successful!

1328483862490574849 2020-11-16 15:43:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Big victory moments ago in the State of Nevada. The all Democrat County Commissioner race, on same ballot as President, just thrown out because of large scale voter discrepancy. Clark County officials do not have confidence in their own election security. Major impact!
1328448530504163329 2020-11-16 13:23:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The rate of rejected Mail-In Ballots is 30 X’s lower in Pennsylvania this year than it was in 2016. This is why they kept our poll watchers and observers out of the “SACRED” vote counting rooms!  https://t.co/QPlzfimbd4
1328382287331856384 2020-11-16 08:59:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Georgia won’t let us look at the all important signature match. Without that the recount is MEANINGLESS. Open up unconstitutional Consent Decree, NOW! @BrianKempGA

1328338241284616193 2020-11-16 06:04:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake recount going on in Georgia means nothing because they are not allowing signatures to be looked at and verified. Break the unconstitutional Consent Decree!
1328334945148952576 2020-11-16 05:51:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I won the Election!

1328324377168015360 2020-11-16 05:09:45 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Washington Post forgot to read the complaint. Fake News. Poll Watchers, and the way they were treated, are a very big deal in the complaint!
1328200072987893762 2020-11-15 20:55:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I WON THE ELECTION!
1328152466752491526 2020-11-15 17:46:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....owned Dominion Voting Systems, turned down by Texas and many others because it was not good or secure, those responsible for the safeguarding of our Constitution cannot allow the Fake results of the 2020 Mail-In Election to stand. The World is watching!
1328152465016020993 2020-11-15 17:46:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....perhaps like never before! From large numbers of Poll Watchers that were thrown out of vote counting rooms in many of our States, to millions of ballots that have been altered by Democrats, only for Democrats, to voting after the Election was over, to using Radical Left
1328152462331699202 2020-11-15 17:46:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why does the Fake News Media continuously assume that Joe Biden will ascend to the Presidency, not even allowing our side to show, which we are just getting ready to do, how badly shattered and violated our great Constitution has been in the 2020 Election. It was attacked,..
1328137498069970947 2020-11-15 16:47:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A great launch! @NASA was a closed up disaster when we took over. Now it is again the “hottest”, most advanced, space center in the world, by far!
1328100945570500608 2020-11-15 14:21:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Many of the court cases being filed all over the Country are not ours, but rather those of people that have seen horrible abuses. Our big cases showing the unconstitutionality of the 2020 Election, &amp; the outrage of things that were done to change the outcome, will soon be filed!

1328055196904251397 2020-11-15 11:20:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> John Bolton was one of the dumbest people in government that I’ve had the “pleasure” to work with. A sullen, dull and quiet guy, he added nothing to National Security except, “Gee, let’s go to war.” Also, illegally released much Classified Information. A real dope!

1327979630477922304 2020-11-15 06:19:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!
1327978710809661440 2020-11-15 06:16:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> RIGGED ELECTION. WE WILL WIN!
1327960545929072645 2020-11-15 05:04:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Watch @RudyGiuliani interview on @MariaBartiromo this morning at 10:00. Doing a great job exposing the Rigged Election Hoax!
1327958640309972992 2020-11-15 04:56:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> All of the mechanical “glitches” that took place on Election Night were really THEM getting caught trying to steal votes. They succeeded plenty, however, without getting caught. Mail-in elections are a sick joke!
1327956491056279552 2020-11-15 04:47:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He won because the Election was Rigged. NO VOTE WATCHERS OR OBSERVERS allowed, vote tabulated by a Radical Left privately owned company, Dominion, with a bad reputation &amp; bum equipment that couldn’t even qualify for Texas (which I won by a lot!), the Fake &amp; Silent Media, &amp; more!
1327950785959915520 2020-11-15 04:25:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is why @FoxNews daytime and weekend daytime have lost their ratings. They are abysmal having @alfredenewman1 (Mayor Pete of Indiana’s most unsuccessful city, by far!) on more than Republicans. Many great alternatives are forming &amp; exist. Try @OANN &amp; @newsmax, among others!

1327838908089069568 2020-11-14 21:00:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News Media hardly even discussed the tens of thousands of people that came to D.C. Formed organically, and in many parts of the Country!
1327837956820914178 2020-11-14 20:56:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mollie. The Free and Fair Press is gone in our country. They only write about what they want to write about. SUPPRESSION!
1327836670742450177 2020-11-14 20:51:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Silent Media is the Enemy of the People!!!
1327834542707793921 2020-11-14 20:43:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Radical Left ANTIFA SCUM was easily rebuffed today by the big D.C. MAGA Rally crowd, only to return at night, after 99% of the crowd had left, to assault elderly people and families. Police got there, but late. Mayor is not doing her job!
1327828007311073280 2020-11-14 20:17:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ANTIFA SCUM ran for the hills today when they tried attacking the people at the Trump Rally, because those people aggressively fought back. Antifa waited until tonight, when 99% were gone, to attack innocent #MAGA People. DC Police, get going — do your job and don’t hold back!!!
1327811527123103746 2020-11-14 19:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I look forward to Mayor Giuliani spearheading the legal effort to defend OUR RIGHT to FREE and FAIR ELECTIONS! Rudy Giuliani, Joseph diGenova, Victoria Toensing, Sidney Powell, and Jenna Ellis, a truly great team, added to our other wonderful lawyers and representatives!
1327750127679889409 2020-11-14 15:07:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There is tremendous evidence of wide spread voter fraud in that there is irrefutable proof that our Republican poll watchers and observers were not allowed to be present in poll counting rooms. Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and others. Unconstitutional!

1327717223142731779 2020-11-14 12:57:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They wouldn’t let our Poll Watchers and Observers into the Counting Rooms. We win on that alone!

1327715767916392449 2020-11-14 12:51:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The hand recount taking place in Georgia is a waste of time. They are not showing the matching signatures. Call off the recount until they allow the MATCH. Don’t let the Radical Left Dems STEAL THE ELECTION!
1327708998662025216 2020-11-14 12:24:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hundreds of thousands of people showing their support in D.C. They will not stand for a Rigged and Corrupt Election!
1327707126375051267 2020-11-14 12:17:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We will WIN!
1327704841964183552 2020-11-14 12:07:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> People are not going to stand for having this Election stolen from them by a privately owned Radical Left company, Dominion, and many other reasons!

1327638503883235332 2020-11-14 07:44:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....We cannot waste time and can only give to those states that will use the Vaccine immediately. Therefore the New York delay. Many lives to be saved, but we are ready when they are. Stop playing politics!
1327638502280925184 2020-11-14 07:44:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I LOVE NEW YORK! As everyone knows, the Trump Administration has produced a great and safe VACCINE far ahead of schedule. Another Administration would have taken five years. The problem is, @NYGovCuomo said that he will delay using it, and other states WANT IT NOW...

1327619654592892931 2020-11-14 06:29:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....What are they trying to hide. They know, and so does everyone else. EXPOSE THE CRIME!
1327619653020110850 2020-11-14 06:29:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Consent Decree signed by the Georgia Secretary of State, with the approval of Governor @BrianKempGA, at the urging of @staceyabrams, makes it impossible to check &amp; match signatures on ballots and envelopes, etc. They knew they were going to cheat. Must expose real signatures!

1327438487537246210 2020-11-13 18:29:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow. This is exactly what happened to us. Great courage by judge!

1329093126238203905 2020-11-18 08:04:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Great State of Michigan, with votes being far greater than the number of people who voted, cannot certify the election. The Democrats cheated big time, and got caught. A Republican WIN!
1329087255168708608 2020-11-18 07:41:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In Detroit, there are FAR MORE VOTES THAN PEOPLE. Nothing can be done to cure that giant scam. I win Michigan!
1329086548093014022 2020-11-18 07:38:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The numbers have not improved, it is still 71% out of balance”, stated Wayne County, Michigan,  Canvassers. “There is widespread irregularities in poll numbers.” There are “more votes than people”. The two harassed patriot Canvassers refuse to sign the papers!
1329075487553974275 2020-11-18 06:54:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THEY WOULD’NT LET REPUBLICAN POLL WATCHERS INTO THE COUNTING ROOMS. UNCONSTITUTIONAL!!!
1329069814195871744 2020-11-18 06:31:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Georgia recount is a joke and is being done UNDER PROTEST. Even though thousands of fraudulent votes have been found, the real number is in matching signatures. Governor must open up the unconstitutional Consent Decree and call in the Legislature!
1329065945160175616 2020-11-18 06:16:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They didn’t even allow Republican Observers into the building to watch. A terrible insult to our Constitution!
1329064787142172673 2020-11-18 06:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This was a rigged election. No Republican Poll Watchers allowed, voting machine “glitches” all over the place (meaning they got caught cheating!), voting after election ended, and so much more!
1329060562442067969 2020-11-18 05:55:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wrong! At first they voted against because there were far more VOTES than PEOPLE (Sad!). Then they were threatened, screamed at and viciously harassed, and were FORCED to change their vote, but then REFUSED, as American patriots, to sign the documents. 71% MESS. Don’t Harass!
1329054683441278977 2020-11-18 05:31:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...AND I WON THE ELECTION. VOTER FRAUD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY!

1328900747497525248 2020-11-17 19:20:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Governor Kemp will hopefully see the light before it is too late. Must finally take charge! Two GREAT Senators, who do so much for Georgia and truly love the USA, are in a must win battle with two incompetents who don’t have a clue!
1328886891765182466 2020-11-17 18:24:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Well, it’s really quite simple. You just can’t have more votes than people!
1328886157246156801 2020-11-17 18:22:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> More votes than people, and that is the least of it!!!
1328885313729687553 2020-11-17 18:18:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Flip Michigan back to TRUMP. Detroit, not surprisingly, has tremendous problems!
1328883405837258753 2020-11-17 18:11:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Michigan just refused to certify the election results! Having courage is a beautiful thing. The USA stands proud!

1328856932011167744 2020-11-17 16:25:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The only thing secure about our 2020 Election was that it was virtually impenetrable by foreign powers. On that, the Trump Administration takes great credit. Unfortunately, the Radical Left Democrats, Dominion, and others, were perhaps more successful!

1328483862490574849 2020-11-16 15:43:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Big victory moments ago in the State of Nevada. The all Democrat County Commissioner race, on same ballot as President, just thrown out because of large scale voter discrepancy. Clark County officials do not have confidence in their own election security. Major impact!
1328448530504163329 2020-11-16 13:23:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The rate of rejected Mail-In Ballots is 30 X’s lower in Pennsylvania this year than it was in 2016. This is why they kept our poll watchers and observers out of the “SACRED” vote counting rooms!  https://t.co/QPlzfimbd4
1328382287331856384 2020-11-16 08:59:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Georgia won’t let us look at the all important signature match. Without that the recount is MEANINGLESS. Open up unconstitutional Consent Decree, NOW! @BrianKempGA

1328338241284616193 2020-11-16 06:04:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake recount going on in Georgia means nothing because they are not allowing signatures to be looked at and verified. Break the unconstitutional Consent Decree!

1328324377168015360 2020-11-16 05:09:45 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Washington Post forgot to read the complaint. Fake News. Poll Watchers, and the way they were treated, are a very big deal in the complaint!
1328200072987893762 2020-11-15 20:55:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I WON THE ELECTION!
1328152466752491526 2020-11-15 17:46:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....owned Dominion Voting Systems, turned down by Texas and many others because it was not good or secure, those responsible for the safeguarding of our Constitution cannot allow the Fake results of the 2020 Mail-In Election to stand. The World is watching!
1328152465016020993 2020-11-15 17:46:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....perhaps like never before! From large numbers of Poll Watchers that were thrown out of vote counting rooms in many of our States, to millions of ballots that have been altered by Democrats, only for Democrats, to voting after the Election was over, to using Radical Left
1328152462331699202 2020-11-15 17:46:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why does the Fake News Media continuously assume that Joe Biden will ascend to the Presidency, not even allowing our side to show, which we are just getting ready to do, how badly shattered and violated our great Constitution has been in the 2020 Election. It was attacked,..
1328137498069970947 2020-11-15 16:47:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A great launch! @NASA was a closed up disaster when we took over. Now it is again the “hottest”, most advanced, space center in the world, by far!
1328100945570500608 2020-11-15 14:21:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Many of the court cases being filed all over the Country are not ours, but rather those of people that have seen horrible abuses. Our big cases showing the unconstitutionality of the 2020 Election, &amp; the outrage of things that were done to change the outcome, will soon be filed!

1328055196904251397 2020-11-15 11:20:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> John Bolton was one of the dumbest people in government that I’ve had the “pleasure” to work with. A sullen, dull and quiet guy, he added nothing to National Security except, “Gee, let’s go to war.” Also, illegally released much Classified Information. A real dope!

1327979630477922304 2020-11-15 06:19:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!
1327978710809661440 2020-11-15 06:16:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> RIGGED ELECTION. WE WILL WIN!
1327960545929072645 2020-11-15 05:04:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Watch @RudyGiuliani interview on @MariaBartiromo this morning at 10:00. Doing a great job exposing the Rigged Election Hoax!
1327958640309972992 2020-11-15 04:56:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> All of the mechanical “glitches” that took place on Election Night were really THEM getting caught trying to steal votes. They succeeded plenty, however, without getting caught. Mail-in elections are a sick joke!
1327956491056279552 2020-11-15 04:47:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He won because the Election was Rigged. NO VOTE WATCHERS OR OBSERVERS allowed, vote tabulated by a Radical Left privately owned company, Dominion, with a bad reputation &amp; bum equipment that couldn’t even qualify for Texas (which I won by a lot!), the Fake &amp; Silent Media, &amp; more!
1327950785959915520 2020-11-15 04:25:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is why @FoxNews daytime and weekend daytime have lost their ratings. They are abysmal having @alfredenewman1 (Mayor Pete of Indiana’s most unsuccessful city, by far!) on more than Republicans. Many great alternatives are forming &amp; exist. Try @OANN &amp; @newsmax, among others!

1327838908089069568 2020-11-14 21:00:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News Media hardly even discussed the tens of thousands of people that came to D.C. Formed organically, and in many parts of the Country!
1327837956820914178 2020-11-14 20:56:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mollie. The Free and Fair Press is gone in our country. They only write about what they want to write about. SUPPRESSION!
1327836670742450177 2020-11-14 20:51:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Silent Media is the Enemy of the People!!!
1327834542707793921 2020-11-14 20:43:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Radical Left ANTIFA SCUM was easily rebuffed today by the big D.C. MAGA Rally crowd, only to return at night, after 99% of the crowd had left, to assault elderly people and families. Police got there, but late. Mayor is not doing her job!
1327828007311073280 2020-11-14 20:17:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ANTIFA SCUM ran for the hills today when they tried attacking the people at the Trump Rally, because those people aggressively fought back. Antifa waited until tonight, when 99% were gone, to attack innocent #MAGA People. DC Police, get going — do your job and don’t hold back!!!
1327811527123103746 2020-11-14 19:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I look forward to Mayor Giuliani spearheading the legal effort to defend OUR RIGHT to FREE and FAIR ELECTIONS! Rudy Giuliani, Joseph diGenova, Victoria Toensing, Sidney Powell, and Jenna Ellis, a truly great team, added to our other wonderful lawyers and representatives!
1327750127679889409 2020-11-14 15:07:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There is tremendous evidence of wide spread voter fraud in that there is irrefutable proof that our Republican poll watchers and observers were not allowed to be present in poll counting rooms. Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and others. Unconstitutional!

1327717223142731779 2020-11-14 12:57:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They wouldn’t let our Poll Watchers and Observers into the Counting Rooms. We win on that alone!

1327715767916392449 2020-11-14 12:51:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The hand recount taking place in Georgia is a waste of time. They are not showing the matching signatures. Call off the recount until they allow the MATCH. Don’t let the Radical Left Dems STEAL THE ELECTION!
1327708998662025216 2020-11-14 12:24:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hundreds of thousands of people showing their support in D.C. They will not stand for a Rigged and Corrupt Election!
1327707126375051267 2020-11-14 12:17:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We will WIN!
1327704841964183552 2020-11-14 12:07:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> People are not going to stand for having this Election stolen from them by a privately owned Radical Left company, Dominion, and many other reasons!

1327638503883235332 2020-11-14 07:44:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....We cannot waste time and can only give to those states that will use the Vaccine immediately. Therefore the New York delay. Many lives to be saved, but we are ready when they are. Stop playing politics!
1327638502280925184 2020-11-14 07:44:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I LOVE NEW YORK! As everyone knows, the Trump Administration has produced a great and safe VACCINE far ahead of schedule. Another Administration would have taken five years. The problem is, @NYGovCuomo said that he will delay using it, and other states WANT IT NOW...

1327619654592892931 2020-11-14 06:29:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....What are they trying to hide. They know, and so does everyone else. EXPOSE THE CRIME!
1327619653020110850 2020-11-14 06:29:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Consent Decree signed by the Georgia Secretary of State, with the approval of Governor @BrianKempGA, at the urging of @staceyabrams, makes it impossible to check &amp; match signatures on ballots and envelopes, etc. They knew they were going to cheat. Must expose real signatures!

1327438487537246210 2020-11-13 18:29:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow. This is exactly what happened to us. Great courage by judge!

1329093126238203905 2020-11-18 08:04:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Great State of Michigan, with votes being far greater than the number of people who voted, cannot certify the election. The Democrats cheated big time, and got caught. A Republican WIN!
1329087255168708608 2020-11-18 07:41:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In Detroit, there are FAR MORE VOTES THAN PEOPLE. Nothing can be done to cure that giant scam. I win Michigan!
1329086548093014022 2020-11-18 07:38:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The numbers have not improved, it is still 71% out of balance”, stated Wayne County, Michigan,  Canvassers. “There is widespread irregularities in poll numbers.” There are “more votes than people”. The two harassed patriot Canvassers refuse to sign the papers!
1329075487553974275 2020-11-18 06:54:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THEY WOULD’NT LET REPUBLICAN POLL WATCHERS INTO THE COUNTING ROOMS. UNCONSTITUTIONAL!!!
1329069814195871744 2020-11-18 06:31:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Georgia recount is a joke and is being done UNDER PROTEST. Even though thousands of fraudulent votes have been found, the real number is in matching signatures. Governor must open up the unconstitutional Consent Decree and call in the Legislature!
1329065945160175616 2020-11-18 06:16:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They didn’t even allow Republican Observers into the building to watch. A terrible insult to our Constitution!
1329064787142172673 2020-11-18 06:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This was a rigged election. No Republican Poll Watchers allowed, voting machine “glitches” all over the place (meaning they got caught cheating!), voting after election ended, and so much more!
1329060562442067969 2020-11-18 05:55:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wrong! At first they voted against because there were far more VOTES than PEOPLE (Sad!). Then they were threatened, screamed at and viciously harassed, and were FORCED to change their vote, but then REFUSED, as American patriots, to sign the documents. 71% MESS. Don’t Harass!
1329054683441278977 2020-11-18 05:31:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...AND I WON THE ELECTION. VOTER FRAUD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY!
1329050677541281795 2020-11-18 05:15:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Trump votes.
1328900747497525248 2020-11-17 19:20:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Governor Kemp will hopefully see the light before it is too late. Must finally take charge! Two GREAT Senators, who do so much for Georgia and truly love the USA, are in a must win battle with two incompetents who don’t have a clue!
1328886891765182466 2020-11-17 18:24:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Well, it’s really quite simple. You just can’t have more votes than people!
1328886157246156801 2020-11-17 18:22:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> More votes than people, and that is the least of it!!!
1328885313729687553 2020-11-17 18:18:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Flip Michigan back to TRUMP. Detroit, not surprisingly, has tremendous problems!
1328883405837258753 2020-11-17 18:11:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Michigan just refused to certify the election results! Having courage is a beautiful thing. The USA stands proud!

1328856932011167744 2020-11-17 16:25:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The only thing secure about our 2020 Election was that it was virtually impenetrable by foreign powers. On that, the Trump Administration takes great credit. Unfortunately, the Radical Left Democrats, Dominion, and others, were perhaps more successful!

1328483862490574849 2020-11-16 15:43:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Big victory moments ago in the State of Nevada. The all Democrat County Commissioner race, on same ballot as President, just thrown out because of large scale voter discrepancy. Clark County officials do not have confidence in their own election security. Major impact!
1328448530504163329 2020-11-16 13:23:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The rate of rejected Mail-In Ballots is 30 X’s lower in Pennsylvania this year than it was in 2016. This is why they kept our poll watchers and observers out of the “SACRED” vote counting rooms!  https://t.co/QPlzfimbd4
1328382287331856384 2020-11-16 08:59:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Georgia won’t let us look at the all important signature match. Without that the recount is MEANINGLESS. Open up unconstitutional Consent Decree, NOW! @BrianKempGA

1328338241284616193 2020-11-16 06:04:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake recount going on in Georgia means nothing because they are not allowing signatures to be looked at and verified. Break the unconstitutional Consent Decree!

1328324377168015360 2020-11-16 05:09:45 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Washington Post forgot to read the complaint. Fake News. Poll Watchers, and the way they were treated, are a very big deal in the complaint!
1328200072987893762 2020-11-15 20:55:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I WON THE ELECTION!
1328152466752491526 2020-11-15 17:46:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....owned Dominion Voting Systems, turned down by Texas and many others because it was not good or secure, those responsible for the safeguarding of our Constitution cannot allow the Fake results of the 2020 Mail-In Election to stand. The World is watching!
1328152465016020993 2020-11-15 17:46:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....perhaps like never before! From large numbers of Poll Watchers that were thrown out of vote counting rooms in many of our States, to millions of ballots that have been altered by Democrats, only for Democrats, to voting after the Election was over, to using Radical Left
1328152462331699202 2020-11-15 17:46:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why does the Fake News Media continuously assume that Joe Biden will ascend to the Presidency, not even allowing our side to show, which we are just getting ready to do, how badly shattered and violated our great Constitution has been in the 2020 Election. It was attacked,..
1328137498069970947 2020-11-15 16:47:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A great launch! @NASA was a closed up disaster when we took over. Now it is again the “hottest”, most advanced, space center in the world, by far!
1328100945570500608 2020-11-15 14:21:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Many of the court cases being filed all over the Country are not ours, but rather those of people that have seen horrible abuses. Our big cases showing the unconstitutionality of the 2020 Election, &amp; the outrage of things that were done to change the outcome, will soon be filed!

1328055196904251397 2020-11-15 11:20:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> John Bolton was one of the dumbest people in government that I’ve had the “pleasure” to work with. A sullen, dull and quiet guy, he added nothing to National Security except, “Gee, let’s go to war.” Also, illegally released much Classified Information. A real dope!

1327979630477922304 2020-11-15 06:19:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!
1327978710809661440 2020-11-15 06:16:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> RIGGED ELECTION. WE WILL WIN!
1327960545929072645 2020-11-15 05:04:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Watch @RudyGiuliani interview on @MariaBartiromo this morning at 10:00. Doing a great job exposing the Rigged Election Hoax!
1327958640309972992 2020-11-15 04:56:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> All of the mechanical “glitches” that took place on Election Night were really THEM getting caught trying to steal votes. They succeeded plenty, however, without getting caught. Mail-in elections are a sick joke!
1327956491056279552 2020-11-15 04:47:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He won because the Election was Rigged. NO VOTE WATCHERS OR OBSERVERS allowed, vote tabulated by a Radical Left privately owned company, Dominion, with a bad reputation &amp; bum equipment that couldn’t even qualify for Texas (which I won by a lot!), the Fake &amp; Silent Media, &amp; more!
1327950785959915520 2020-11-15 04:25:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is why @FoxNews daytime and weekend daytime have lost their ratings. They are abysmal having @alfredenewman1 (Mayor Pete of Indiana’s most unsuccessful city, by far!) on more than Republicans. Many great alternatives are forming &amp; exist. Try @OANN &amp; @newsmax, among others!

1327838908089069568 2020-11-14 21:00:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News Media hardly even discussed the tens of thousands of people that came to D.C. Formed organically, and in many parts of the Country!

1327836670742450177 2020-11-14 20:51:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Silent Media is the Enemy of the People!!!
1327834542707793921 2020-11-14 20:43:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Radical Left ANTIFA SCUM was easily rebuffed today by the big D.C. MAGA Rally crowd, only to return at night, after 99% of the crowd had left, to assault elderly people and families. Police got there, but late. Mayor is not doing her job!
1327828007311073280 2020-11-14 20:17:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ANTIFA SCUM ran for the hills today when they tried attacking the people at the Trump Rally, because those people aggressively fought back. Antifa waited until tonight, when 99% were gone, to attack innocent #MAGA People. DC Police, get going — do your job and don’t hold back!!!
1327811527123103746 2020-11-14 19:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I look forward to Mayor Giuliani spearheading the legal effort to defend OUR RIGHT to FREE and FAIR ELECTIONS! Rudy Giuliani, Joseph diGenova, Victoria Toensing, Sidney Powell, and Jenna Ellis, a truly great team, added to our other wonderful lawyers and representatives!
1327750127679889409 2020-11-14 15:07:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There is tremendous evidence of wide spread voter fraud in that there is irrefutable proof that our Republican poll watchers and observers were not allowed to be present in poll counting rooms. Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and others. Unconstitutional!

1327717223142731779 2020-11-14 12:57:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They wouldn’t let our Poll Watchers and Observers into the Counting Rooms. We win on that alone!

1327715767916392449 2020-11-14 12:51:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The hand recount taking place in Georgia is a waste of time. They are not showing the matching signatures. Call off the recount until they allow the MATCH. Don’t let the Radical Left Dems STEAL THE ELECTION!
1327708998662025216 2020-11-14 12:24:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hundreds of thousands of people showing their support in D.C. They will not stand for a Rigged and Corrupt Election!
1327707126375051267 2020-11-14 12:17:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We will WIN!
1327704841964183552 2020-11-14 12:07:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> People are not going to stand for having this Election stolen from them by a privately owned Radical Left company, Dominion, and many other reasons!

1327638503883235332 2020-11-14 07:44:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....We cannot waste time and can only give to those states that will use the Vaccine immediately. Therefore the New York delay. Many lives to be saved, but we are ready when they are. Stop playing politics!
1327638502280925184 2020-11-14 07:44:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I LOVE NEW YORK! As everyone knows, the Trump Administration has produced a great and safe VACCINE far ahead of schedule. Another Administration would have taken five years. The problem is, @NYGovCuomo said that he will delay using it, and other states WANT IT NOW...

1327633164823617548 2020-11-14 07:23:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congress must now do a Covid Relief Bill. Needs Democrats support. Make it big and focused. Get it done!
1327619654592892931 2020-11-14 06:29:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....What are they trying to hide. They know, and so does everyone else. EXPOSE THE CRIME!
1327619653020110850 2020-11-14 06:29:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Consent Decree signed by the Georgia Secretary of State, with the approval of Governor @BrianKempGA, at the urging of @staceyabrams, makes it impossible to check &amp; match signatures on ballots and envelopes, etc. They knew they were going to cheat. Must expose real signatures!

1327438487537246210 2020-11-13 18:29:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow. This is exactly what happened to us. Great courage by judge!

1329093126238203905 2020-11-18 08:04:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Great State of Michigan, with votes being far greater than the number of people who voted, cannot certify the election. The Democrats cheated big time, and got caught. A Republican WIN!
1329087255168708608 2020-11-18 07:41:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In Detroit, there are FAR MORE VOTES THAN PEOPLE. Nothing can be done to cure that giant scam. I win Michigan!
1329086548093014022 2020-11-18 07:38:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The numbers have not improved, it is still 71% out of balance”, stated Wayne County, Michigan,  Canvassers. “There is widespread irregularities in poll numbers.” There are “more votes than people”. The two harassed patriot Canvassers refuse to sign the papers!
1329075487553974275 2020-11-18 06:54:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THEY WOULD’NT LET REPUBLICAN POLL WATCHERS INTO THE COUNTING ROOMS. UNCONSTITUTIONAL!!!
1329069814195871744 2020-11-18 06:31:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Georgia recount is a joke and is being done UNDER PROTEST. Even though thousands of fraudulent votes have been found, the real number is in matching signatures. Governor must open up the unconstitutional Consent Decree and call in the Legislature!
1329065945160175616 2020-11-18 06:16:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They didn’t even allow Republican Observers into the building to watch. A terrible insult to our Constitution!
1329064787142172673 2020-11-18 06:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This was a rigged election. No Republican Poll Watchers allowed, voting machine “glitches” all over the place (meaning they got caught cheating!), voting after election ended, and so much more!
1329060562442067969 2020-11-18 05:55:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wrong! At first they voted against because there were far more VOTES than PEOPLE (Sad!). Then they were threatened, screamed at and viciously harassed, and were FORCED to change their vote, but then REFUSED, as American patriots, to sign the documents. 71% MESS. Don’t Harass!
1329054683441278977 2020-11-18 05:31:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...AND I WON THE ELECTION. VOTER FRAUD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY!
1329050677541281795 2020-11-18 05:15:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Trump votes.
1328900747497525248 2020-11-17 19:20:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Governor Kemp will hopefully see the light before it is too late. Must finally take charge! Two GREAT Senators, who do so much for Georgia and truly love the USA, are in a must win battle with two incompetents who don’t have a clue!
1328886891765182466 2020-11-17 18:24:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Well, it’s really quite simple. You just can’t have more votes than people!
1328886157246156801 2020-11-17 18:22:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> More votes than people, and that is the least of it!!!
1328885313729687553 2020-11-17 18:18:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Flip Michigan back to TRUMP. Detroit, not surprisingly, has tremendous problems!
1328883405837258753 2020-11-17 18:11:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Michigan just refused to certify the election results! Having courage is a beautiful thing. The USA stands proud!

1328856932011167744 2020-11-17 16:25:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The only thing secure about our 2020 Election was that it was virtually impenetrable by foreign powers. On that, the Trump Administration takes great credit. Unfortunately, the Radical Left Democrats, Dominion, and others, were perhaps more successful!
1328853928025403394 2020-11-17 16:14:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THANK YOU!  https://t.co/DrtsiD71i4

1328483862490574849 2020-11-16 15:43:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Big victory moments ago in the State of Nevada. The all Democrat County Commissioner race, on same ballot as President, just thrown out because of large scale voter discrepancy. Clark County officials do not have confidence in their own election security. Major impact!
1328448530504163329 2020-11-16 13:23:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The rate of rejected Mail-In Ballots is 30 X’s lower in Pennsylvania this year than it was in 2016. This is why they kept our poll watchers and observers out of the “SACRED” vote counting rooms!  https://t.co/QPlzfimbd4
1328382287331856384 2020-11-16 08:59:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Georgia won’t let us look at the all important signature match. Without that the recount is MEANINGLESS. Open up unconstitutional Consent Decree, NOW! @BrianKempGA

1328338630679597056 2020-11-16 06:06:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Try watching @OANN. Really GREAT!
1328338241284616193 2020-11-16 06:04:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake recount going on in Georgia means nothing because they are not allowing signatures to be looked at and verified. Break the unconstitutional Consent Decree!
1328334945148952576 2020-11-16 05:51:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I won the Election!

1328324377168015360 2020-11-16 05:09:45 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Washington Post forgot to read the complaint. Fake News. Poll Watchers, and the way they were treated, are a very big deal in the complaint!
1328200072987893762 2020-11-15 20:55:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I WON THE ELECTION!
1328152466752491526 2020-11-15 17:46:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....owned Dominion Voting Systems, turned down by Texas and many others because it was not good or secure, those responsible for the safeguarding of our Constitution cannot allow the Fake results of the 2020 Mail-In Election to stand. The World is watching!
1328152465016020993 2020-11-15 17:46:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....perhaps like never before! From large numbers of Poll Watchers that were thrown out of vote counting rooms in many of our States, to millions of ballots that have been altered by Democrats, only for Democrats, to voting after the Election was over, to using Radical Left
1328152462331699202 2020-11-15 17:46:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why does the Fake News Media continuously assume that Joe Biden will ascend to the Presidency, not even allowing our side to show, which we are just getting ready to do, how badly shattered and violated our great Constitution has been in the 2020 Election. It was attacked,..
1328137498069970947 2020-11-15 16:47:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A great launch! @NASA was a closed up disaster when we took over. Now it is again the “hottest”, most advanced, space center in the world, by far!
1328100945570500608 2020-11-15 14:21:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Many of the court cases being filed all over the Country are not ours, but rather those of people that have seen horrible abuses. Our big cases showing the unconstitutionality of the 2020 Election, &amp; the outrage of things that were done to change the outcome, will soon be filed!

1328055196904251397 2020-11-15 11:20:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> John Bolton was one of the dumbest people in government that I’ve had the “pleasure” to work with. A sullen, dull and quiet guy, he added nothing to National Security except, “Gee, let’s go to war.” Also, illegally released much Classified Information. A real dope!

1327978710809661440 2020-11-15 06:16:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> RIGGED ELECTION. WE WILL WIN!
1327960545929072645 2020-11-15 05:04:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Watch @RudyGiuliani interview on @MariaBartiromo this morning at 10:00. Doing a great job exposing the Rigged Election Hoax!
1327958640309972992 2020-11-15 04:56:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> All of the mechanical “glitches” that took place on Election Night were really THEM getting caught trying to steal votes. They succeeded plenty, however, without getting caught. Mail-in elections are a sick joke!
1327956491056279552 2020-11-15 04:47:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He won because the Election was Rigged. NO VOTE WATCHERS OR OBSERVERS allowed, vote tabulated by a Radical Left privately owned company, Dominion, with a bad reputation &amp; bum equipment that couldn’t even qualify for Texas (which I won by a lot!), the Fake &amp; Silent Media, &amp; more!
1327950785959915520 2020-11-15 04:25:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is why @FoxNews daytime and weekend daytime have lost their ratings. They are abysmal having @alfredenewman1 (Mayor Pete of Indiana’s most unsuccessful city, by far!) on more than Republicans. Many great alternatives are forming &amp; exist.

1327840088731029504 2020-11-14 21:05:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mark, but the Fake News Media will never say it!
1327838908089069568 2020-11-14 21:00:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News Media hardly even discussed the tens of thousands of people that came to D.C. Formed organically, and in many parts of the Country!
1327837956820914178 2020-11-14 20:56:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mollie. The Free and Fair Press is gone in our country. They only write about what they want to write about. SUPPRESSION!

1327834542707793921 2020-11-14 20:43:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Radical Left ANTIFA SCUM was easily rebuffed today by the big D.C. MAGA Rally crowd, only to return at night, after 99% of the crowd had left, to assault elderly people and families. Police got there, but late. Mayor is not doing her job!
1327828007311073280 2020-11-14 20:17:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ANTIFA SCUM ran for the hills today when they tried attacking the people at the Trump Rally, because those people aggressively fought back. Antifa waited until tonight, when 99% were gone, to attack innocent #MAGA People. DC Police, get going — do your job and don’t hold back!!!
1327811527123103746 2020-11-14 19:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I look forward to Mayor Giuliani spearheading the legal effort to defend OUR RIGHT to FREE and FAIR ELECTIONS! Rudy Giuliani, Joseph diGenova, Victoria Toensing, Sidney Powell, and Jenna Ellis, a truly great team, added to our other wonderful lawyers and representatives!
1327750127679889409 2020-11-14 15:07:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There is tremendous evidence of wide spread voter fraud in that there is irrefutable proof that our Republican poll watchers and observers were not allowed to be present in poll counting rooms. Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and others. Unconstitutional!

1327717223142731779 2020-11-14 12:57:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They wouldn’t let our Poll Watchers and Observers into the Counting Rooms. We win on that alone!

1327715767916392449 2020-11-14 12:51:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The hand recount taking place in Georgia is a waste of time. They are not showing the matching signatures. Call off the recount until they allow the MATCH. Don’t let the Radical Left Dems STEAL THE ELECTION!
1327708998662025216 2020-11-14 12:24:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hundreds of thousands of people showing their support in D.C. They will not stand for a Rigged and Corrupt Election!

1327704841964183552 2020-11-14 12:07:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> People are not going to stand for having this Election stolen from them by a privately owned Radical Left company, Dominion, and many other reasons!

1327638502280925184 2020-11-14 07:44:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I LOVE NEW YORK! As everyone knows, the Trump Administration has produced a great and safe VACCINE far ahead of schedule. Another Administration would have taken five years. The problem is, @NYGovCuomo said that he will delay using it, and other states WANT IT NOW...

1327619653020110850 2020-11-14 06:29:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Consent Decree signed by the Georgia Secretary of State, with the approval of Governor @BrianKempGA, at the urging of @staceyabrams, makes it impossible to check &amp; match signatures on ballots and envelopes, etc. They knew they were going to cheat. Must expose real signatures!

1327438487537246210 2020-11-13 18:29:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow. This is exactly what happened to us. Great courage by judge!

1329093126238203905 2020-11-18 08:04:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Great State of Michigan, with votes being far greater than the number of people who voted, cannot certify the election. The Democrats cheated big time, and got caught. A Republican WIN!
1329087255168708608 2020-11-18 07:41:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In Detroit, there are FAR MORE VOTES THAN PEOPLE. Nothing can be done to cure that giant scam. I win Michigan!
1329086548093014022 2020-11-18 07:38:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The numbers have not improved, it is still 71% out of balance”, stated Wayne County, Michigan,  Canvassers. “There is widespread irregularities in poll numbers.” There are “more votes than people”. The two harassed patriot Canvassers refuse to sign the papers!
1329075487553974275 2020-11-18 06:54:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THEY WOULD’NT LET REPUBLICAN POLL WATCHERS INTO THE COUNTING ROOMS. UNCONSTITUTIONAL!!!
1329069814195871744 2020-11-18 06:31:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Georgia recount is a joke and is being done UNDER PROTEST. Even though thousands of fraudulent votes have been found, the real number is in matching signatures. Governor must open up the unconstitutional Consent Decree and call in the Legislature!
1329065945160175616 2020-11-18 06:16:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They didn’t even allow Republican Observers into the building to watch. A terrible insult to our Constitution!
1329064787142172673 2020-11-18 06:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This was a rigged election. No Republican Poll Watchers allowed, voting machine “glitches” all over the place (meaning they got caught cheating!), voting after election ended, and so much more!
1329060562442067969 2020-11-18 05:55:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wrong! At first they voted against because there were far more VOTES than PEOPLE (Sad!). Then they were threatened, screamed at and viciously harassed, and were FORCED to change their vote, but then REFUSED, as American patriots, to sign the documents. 71% MESS. Don’t Harass!
1329054683441278977 2020-11-18 05:31:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...AND I WON THE ELECTION. VOTER FRAUD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY!

1328900747497525248 2020-11-17 19:20:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Governor Kemp will hopefully see the light before it is too late. Must finally take charge! Two GREAT Senators, who do so much for Georgia and truly love the USA, are in a must win battle with two incompetents who don’t have a clue!
1328886891765182466 2020-11-17 18:24:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Well, it’s really quite simple. You just can’t have more votes than people!
1328886157246156801 2020-11-17 18:22:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> More votes than people, and that is the least of it!!!
1328885313729687553 2020-11-17 18:18:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Flip Michigan back to TRUMP. Detroit, not surprisingly, has tremendous problems!
1328883405837258753 2020-11-17 18:11:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Michigan just refused to certify the election results! Having courage is a beautiful thing. The USA stands proud!

1328856932011167744 2020-11-17 16:25:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The only thing secure about our 2020 Election was that it was virtually impenetrable by foreign powers. On that, the Trump Administration takes great credit. Unfortunately, the Radical Left Democrats, Dominion, and others, were perhaps more successful!

1328448530504163329 2020-11-16 13:23:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The rate of rejected Mail-In Ballots is 30 X’s lower in Pennsylvania this year than it was in 2016. This is why they kept our poll watchers and observers out of the “SACRED” vote counting rooms!  https://t.co/QPlzfimbd4
1328382287331856384 2020-11-16 08:59:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Georgia won’t let us look at the all important signature match. Without that the recount is MEANINGLESS. Open up unconstitutional Consent Decree, NOW! @BrianKempGA

The World is watching!
1328152465016020993 2020-11-15 17:46:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....perhaps like never before! From large numbers of Poll Watchers that were thrown out of vote counting rooms in many of our States, to millions of ballots that have been altered by Democrats, only for Democrats, to voting after the Election was over, to using Radical Left
1328152462331699202 2020-11-15 17:46:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why does the Fake News Media continuously assume that Joe Biden will ascend to the Presidency, not even allowing our side to show, which we are just getting ready to do, how badly shattered and violated our great Constitution has been in the 2020 Election. It was attacked,..
1328137498069970947 2020-11-15 16:47:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A great launch! @NASA was a closed up disaster when we took over. Now it is again the “hottest”, most advanced, space center in the world, by far!

1328055196904251397 2020-11-15 11:20:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> John Bolton was one of the dumbest people in government that I’ve had the “pleasure” to work with. A sullen, dull and quiet guy, he added nothing to National Security except, “Gee, let’s go to war.” Also, illegally released much Classified Information. A real dope!

1327978710809661440 2020-11-15 06:16:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> RIGGED ELECTION. WE WILL WIN!
1327960545929072645 2020-11-15 05:04:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Watch @RudyGiuliani interview on @MariaBartiromo this morning at 10:00. Doing a great job exposing the Rigged Election Hoax!
1327958640309972992 2020-11-15 04:56:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> All of the mechanical “glitches” that took place on Election Night were really THEM getting caught trying to steal votes. They succeeded plenty, however, without getting caught. Mail-in elections are a sick joke!
1327956491056279552 2020-11-15 04:47:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He won because the Election was Rigged. NO VOTE WATCHERS OR OBSERVERS allowed, vote tabulated by a Radical Left privately owned company, Dominion, with a bad reputation &amp; bum equipment that couldn’t even qualify for Texas (which I won by a lot!), the Fake &amp; Silent Media, &amp; more!
1327950785959915520 2020-11-15 04:25:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is why @FoxNews daytime and weekend daytime have lost their ratings. They are abysmal having @alfredenewman1 (Mayor Pete of Indiana’s most unsuccessful city, by far!) on more than Republicans. Many great alternatives are forming &amp; exist. Try @OANN &amp; @newsmax, among others!

1327840088731029504 2020-11-14 21:05:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mark, but the Fake News Media will never say it!
1327838908089069568 2020-11-14 21:00:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News Media hardly even discussed the tens of thousands of people that came to D.C. Formed organically, and in many parts of the Country!
1327837956820914178 2020-11-14 20:56:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mollie. The Free and Fair Press is gone in our country. They only write about what they want to write about. SUPPRESSION!
1327836670742450177 2020-11-14 20:51:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Silent Media is the Enemy of the People!!!
1327834542707793921 2020-11-14 20:43:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Radical Left ANTIFA SCUM was easily rebuffed today by the big D.C. MAGA Rally crowd, only to return at night, after 99% of the crowd had left, to assault elderly people and families. Police got there, but late. Mayor is not doing her job!
1327828007311073280 2020-11-14 20:17:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ANTIFA SCUM ran for the hills today when they tried attacking the people at the Trump Rally, because those people aggressively fought back. Antifa waited until tonight, when 99% were gone, to attack innocent #MAGA People. DC Police, get going — do your job and don’t hold back!!!
1327811527123103746 2020-11-14 19:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I look forward to Mayor Giuliani spearheading the legal effort to defend OUR RIGHT to FREE and FAIR ELECTIONS! Rudy Giuliani, Joseph diGenova, Victoria Toensing, Sidney Powell, and Jenna Ellis, a truly great team, added to our other wonderful lawyers and representatives!
1327750127679889409 2020-11-14 15:07:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There is tremendous evidence of wide spread voter fraud in that there is irrefutable proof that our Republican poll watchers and observers were not allowed to be present in poll counting rooms. Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and others. Unconstitutional!

1327717223142731779 2020-11-14 12:57:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They wouldn’t let our Poll Watchers and Observers into the Counting Rooms. We win on that alone!

1327715767916392449 2020-11-14 12:51:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The hand recount taking place in Georgia is a waste of time. They are not showing the matching signatures. Call off the recount until they allow the MATCH. Don’t let the Radical Left Dems STEAL THE ELECTION!
1327708998662025216 2020-11-14 12:24:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hundreds of thousands of people showing their support in D.C. They will not stand for a Rigged and Corrupt Election!

1327638502280925184 2020-11-14 07:44:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I LOVE NEW YORK! As everyone knows, the Trump Administration has produced a great and safe VACCINE far ahead of schedule. Another Administration would have taken five years. The problem is, @NYGovCuomo said that he will delay using it, and other states WANT IT NOW...

1327619653020110850 2020-11-14 06:29:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Consent Decree signed by the Georgia Secretary of State, with the approval of Governor @BrianKempGA, at the urging of @staceyabrams, makes it impossible to check &amp; match signatures on ballots and envelopes, etc. They knew they were going to cheat. Must expose real signatures!

1329093126238203905 2020-11-18 08:04:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Great State of Michigan, with votes being far greater than the number of people who voted, cannot certify the election. The Democrats cheated big time, and got caught. A Republican WIN!
1329087255168708608 2020-11-18 07:41:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In Detroit, there are FAR MORE VOTES THAN PEOPLE. Nothing can be done to cure that giant scam. I win Michigan!
1329086548093014022 2020-11-18 07:38:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The numbers have not improved, it is still 71% out of balance”, stated Wayne County, Michigan,  Canvassers. “There is widespread irregularities in poll numbers.” There are “more votes than people”. The two harassed patriot Canvassers refuse to sign the papers!
1329075487553974275 2020-11-18 06:54:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THEY WOULD’NT LET REPUBLICAN POLL WATCHERS INTO THE COUNTING ROOMS. UNCONSTITUTIONAL!!!
1329069814195871744 2020-11-18 06:31:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Georgia recount is a joke and is being done UNDER PROTEST. Even though thousands of fraudulent votes have been found, the real number is in matching signatures. Governor must open up the unconstitutional Consent Decree and call in the Legislature!
1329065945160175616 2020-11-18 06:16:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They didn’t even allow Republican Observers into the building to watch. A terrible insult to our Constitution!
1329064787142172673 2020-11-18 06:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This was a rigged election. No Republican Poll Watchers allowed, voting machine “glitches” all over the place (meaning they got caught cheating!), voting after election ended, and so much more!
1329060562442067969 2020-11-18 05:55:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wrong! At first they voted against because there were far more VOTES than PEOPLE (Sad!). Then they were threatened, screamed at and viciously harassed, and were FORCED to change their vote, but then REFUSED, as American patriots, to sign the documents. 71% MESS. Don’t Harass!
1329054683441278977 2020-11-18 05:31:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...AND I WON THE ELECTION. VOTER FRAUD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY!

Two GREAT Senators, who do so much for Georgia and truly love the USA, are in a must win battle with two incompetents who don’t have a clue!
1328886891765182466 2020-11-17 18:24:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Well, it’s really quite simple. You just can’t have more votes than people!
1328886157246156801 2020-11-17 18:22:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> More votes than people, and that is the least of it!!!
1328885313729687553 2020-11-17 18:18:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Flip Michigan back to TRUMP. Detroit, not surprisingly, has tremendous problems!
1328883405837258753 2020-11-17 18:11:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Michigan just refused to certify the election results! Having courage is a beautiful thing. The USA stands proud!

1328856932011167744 2020-11-17 16:25:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The only thing secure about our 2020 Election was that it was virtually impenetrable by foreign powers. On that, the Trump Administration takes great credit. Unfortunately, the Radical Left Democrats, Dominion, and others, were perhaps more successful!

1328338241284616193 2020-11-16 06:04:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake recount going on in Georgia means nothing because they are not allowing signatures to be looked at and verified. Break the unconstitutional Consent Decree!

From large numbers of Poll Watchers that were thrown out of vote counting rooms in many of our States, to millions of ballots that have been altered by Democrats, only for Democrats, to voting after the Election was over, to using Radical Left
1328152462331699202 2020-11-15 17:46:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why does the Fake News Media continuously assume that Joe Biden will ascend to the Presidency, not even allowing our side to show, which we are just getting ready to do, how badly shattered and violated our great Constitution has been in the 2020 Election. It was attacked,..

1328055196904251397 2020-11-15 11:20:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> John Bolton was one of the dumbest people in government that I’ve had the “pleasure” to work with.

1327958640309972992 2020-11-15 04:56:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> All of the mechanical “glitches” that took place on Election Night were really THEM getting caught trying to steal votes. They succeeded plenty, however, without getting caught. Mail-in elections are a sick joke!
1327956491056279552 2020-11-15 04:47:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He won because the Election was Rigged. NO VOTE WATCHERS OR OBSERVERS allowed, vote tabulated by a Radical Left privately owned company, Dominion, with a bad reputation &amp; bum equipment that couldn’t even qualify for Texas (which I won by a lot!), the Fake &amp; Silent Media, &amp; more!
1327950785959915520 2020-11-15 04:25:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is why @FoxNews daytime and weekend daytime have lost their ratings. They are abysmal having @alfredenewman1 (Mayor Pete of Indiana’s most unsuccessful city, by far!) on more than Republicans. Many great alternatives are forming &amp; exist. Try @OANN &amp; @newsmax, among others!
1327840594127974401 2020-11-14 21:07:22 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Tax filings reveal Biden cancer charity spent millions on salaries, zero on research  https://t.co/2DhE1Ddt6y via @nypost
1327840088731029504 2020-11-14 21:05:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mark, but the Fake News Media will never say it!
1327838908089069568 2020-11-14 21:00:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News Media hardly even discussed the tens of thousands of people that came to D.C. Formed organically, and in many parts of the Country!
1327837956820914178 2020-11-14 20:56:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mollie. The Free and Fair Press is gone in our country. They only write about what they want to write about. SUPPRESSION!
1327836670742450177 2020-11-14 20:51:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Silent Media is the Enemy of the People!!!
1327834542707793921 2020-11-14 20:43:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Radical Left ANTIFA SCUM was easily rebuffed today by the big D.C. MAGA Rally crowd, only to return at night, after 99% of the crowd had left, to assault elderly people and families. Police got there, but late. Mayor is not doing her job!
1327828007311073280 2020-11-14 20:17:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ANTIFA SCUM ran for the hills today when they tried attacking the people at the Trump Rally, because those people aggressively fought back. Antifa waited until tonight, when 99% were gone, to attack innocent #MAGA People. DC Police, get going — do your job and don’t hold back!!!
1327811527123103746 2020-11-14 19:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I look forward to Mayor Giuliani spearheading the legal effort to defend OUR RIGHT to FREE and FAIR ELECTIONS! Rudy Giuliani, Joseph diGenova, Victoria Toensing, Sidney Powell, and Jenna Ellis, a truly great team, added to our other wonderful lawyers and representatives!
1327750127679889409 2020-11-14 15:07:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There is tremendous evidence of wide spread voter fraud in that there is irrefutable proof that our Republican poll watchers and observers were not allowed to be present in poll counting rooms. Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and others. Unconstitutional!

1327717223142731779 2020-11-14 12:57:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They wouldn’t let our Poll Watchers and Observers into the Counting Rooms. We win on that alone!

1327715767916392449 2020-11-14 12:51:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The hand recount taking place in Georgia is a waste of time. They are not showing the matching signatures. Call off the recount until they allow the MATCH. Don’t let the Radical Left Dems STEAL THE ELECTION!
1327708998662025216 2020-11-14 12:24:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hundreds of thousands of people showing their support in D.C. They will not stand for a Rigged and Corrupt Election!
1327707126375051267 2020-11-14 12:17:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We will WIN!
1327704841964183552 2020-11-14 12:07:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> People are not going to stand for having this Election stolen from them by a privately owned Radical Left company, Dominion, and many other reasons!

1327638503883235332 2020-11-14 07:44:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....We cannot waste time and can only give to those states that will use the Vaccine immediately. Therefore the New York delay. Many lives to be saved, but we are ready when they are. Stop playing politics!
1327638502280925184 2020-11-14 07:44:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I LOVE NEW YORK! As everyone knows, the Trump Administration has produced a great and safe VACCINE far ahead of schedule. Another Administration would have taken five years. The problem is, @NYGovCuomo said that he will delay using it, and other states WANT IT NOW...

1327633164823617548 2020-11-14 07:23:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congress must now do a Covid Relief Bill. Needs Democrats support. Make it big and focused. Get it done!
1327619654592892931 2020-11-14 06:29:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....What are they trying to hide. They know, and so does everyone else. EXPOSE THE CRIME!
1327619653020110850 2020-11-14 06:29:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Consent Decree signed by the Georgia Secretary of State, with the approval of Governor @BrianKempGA, at the urging of @staceyabrams, makes it impossible to check &amp; match signatures on ballots and envelopes, etc. They knew they were going to cheat. Must expose real signatures!

1327438487537246210 2020-11-13 18:29:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow. This is exactly what happened to us. Great courage by judge!

1329093126238203905 2020-11-18 08:04:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Great State of Michigan, with votes being far greater than the number of people who voted, cannot certify the election. The Democrats cheated big time, and got caught. A Republican WIN!
1329087255168708608 2020-11-18 07:41:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In Detroit, there are FAR MORE VOTES THAN PEOPLE. Nothing can be done to cure that giant scam. I win Michigan!
1329086548093014022 2020-11-18 07:38:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The numbers have not improved, it is still 71% out of balance”, stated Wayne County, Michigan,  Canvassers. “There is widespread irregularities in poll numbers.” There are “more votes than people”. The two harassed patriot Canvassers refuse to sign the papers!
1329075487553974275 2020-11-18 06:54:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THEY WOULD’NT LET REPUBLICAN POLL WATCHERS INTO THE COUNTING ROOMS. UNCONSTITUTIONAL!!!
1329069814195871744 2020-11-18 06:31:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Georgia recount is a joke and is being done UNDER PROTEST. Even though thousands of fraudulent votes have been found, the real number is in matching signatures. Governor must open up the unconstitutional Consent Decree and call in the Legislature!
1329065945160175616 2020-11-18 06:16:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They didn’t even allow Republican Observers into the building to watch. A terrible insult to our Constitution!
1329064787142172673 2020-11-18 06:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This was a rigged election. No Republican Poll Watchers allowed, voting machine “glitches” all over the place (meaning they got caught cheating!), voting after election ended, and so much more!
1329060562442067969 2020-11-18 05:55:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wrong! At first they voted against because there were far more VOTES than PEOPLE (Sad!). Then they were threatened, screamed at and viciously harassed, and were FORCED to change their vote, but then REFUSED, as American patriots, to sign the documents. 71% MESS. Don’t Harass!
1329054683441278977 2020-11-18 05:31:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...AND I WON THE ELECTION. VOTER FRAUD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY!
1329050677541281795 2020-11-18 05:15:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Trump votes.
1328900747497525248 2020-11-17 19:20:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Governor Kemp will hopefully see the light before it is too late. Must finally take charge! Two GREAT Senators, who do so much for Georgia and truly love the USA, are in a must win battle with two incompetents who don’t have a clue!
1328886891765182466 2020-11-17 18:24:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Well, it’s really quite simple. You just can’t have more votes than people!
1328886157246156801 2020-11-17 18:22:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> More votes than people, and that is the least of it!!!
1328885313729687553 2020-11-17 18:18:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Flip Michigan back to TRUMP. Detroit, not surprisingly, has tremendous problems!
1328883405837258753 2020-11-17 18:11:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Michigan just refused to certify the election results! Having courage is a beautiful thing. The USA stands proud!

1328856932011167744 2020-11-17 16:25:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The only thing secure about our 2020 Election was that it was virtually impenetrable by foreign powers. On that, the Trump Administration takes great credit. Unfortunately, the Radical Left Democrats, Dominion, and others, were perhaps more successful!

The all Democrat County Commissioner race, on same ballot as President, just thrown out because of large scale voter discrepancy. Clark County officials do not have confidence in their own election security. Major impact!
1328448530504163329 2020-11-16 13:23:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The rate of rejected Mail-In Ballots is 30 X’s lower in Pennsylvania this year than it was in 2016. This is why they kept our poll watchers and observers out of the “SACRED” vote counting rooms!  https://t.co/QPlzfimbd4
1328382287331856384 2020-11-16 08:59:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Georgia won’t let us look at the all important signature match. Without that the recount is MEANINGLESS. Open up unconstitutional Consent Decree, NOW! @BrianKempGA

1328338241284616193 2020-11-16 06:04:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake recount going on in Georgia means nothing because they are not allowing signatures to be looked at and verified. Break the unconstitutional Consent Decree!

The World is watching!

From large numbers of Poll Watchers that were thrown out of vote counting rooms in many of our States, to millions of ballots that have been altered by Democrats, only for Democrats, to voting after the Election was over, to using Radical Left
1328152462331699202 2020-11-15 17:46:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why does the Fake News Media continuously assume that Joe Biden will ascend to the Presidency, not even allowing our side to show, which we are just getting ready to do, how badly shattered and violated our great Constitution has been in the 2020 Election. It was attacked,..
1328137498069970947 2020-11-15 16:47:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A great launch! @NASA was a closed up disaster when we took over. Now it is again the “hottest”, most advanced, space center in the world, by far!

Our big cases showing the unconstitutionality of the 2020 Election, &amp; the outrage of things that were done to change the outcome, will soon be filed!

1328055196904251397 2020-11-15 11:20:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> John Bolton was one of the dumbest people in government that I’ve had the “pleasure” to work with.

1327978710809661440 2020-11-15 06:16:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> RIGGED ELECTION. WE WILL WIN!
1327960545929072645 2020-11-15 05:04:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Watch @RudyGiuliani interview on @MariaBartiromo this morning at 10:00. Doing a great job exposing the Rigged Election Hoax!
1327958640309972992 2020-11-15 04:56:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> All of the mechanical “glitches” that took place on Election Night were really THEM getting caught trying to steal votes. They succeeded plenty, however, without getting caught. Mail-in elections are a sick joke!
1327956491056279552 2020-11-15 04:47:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He won because the Election was Rigged. NO VOTE WATCHERS OR OBSERVERS allowed, vote tabulated by a Radical Left privately owned company, Dominion, with a bad reputation &amp; bum equipment that couldn’t even qualify for Texas (which I won by a lot!), the Fake &amp; Silent Media, &amp; more!
1327950785959915520 2020-11-15 04:25:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is why @FoxNews daytime and weekend daytime have lost their ratings. They are abysmal having @alfredenewman1 (Mayor Pete of Indiana’s most unsuccessful city, by far!) on more than Republicans. Many great alternatives are forming &amp; exist. Try @OANN &amp; @newsmax, among others!
1327840594127974401 2020-11-14 21:07:22 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Tax filings reveal Biden cancer charity spent millions on salaries, zero on research  https://t.co/2DhE1Ddt6y via @nypost
1327840088731029504 2020-11-14 21:05:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mark, but the Fake News Media will never say it!
1327838908089069568 2020-11-14 21:00:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News Media hardly even discussed the tens of thousands of people that came to D.C. Formed organically, and in many parts of the Country!
1327837956820914178 2020-11-14 20:56:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mollie. The Free and Fair Press is gone in our country. They only write about what they want to write about. SUPPRESSION!
1327836670742450177 2020-11-14 20:51:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Silent Media is the Enemy of the People!!!
1327834542707793921 2020-11-14 20:43:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Radical Left ANTIFA SCUM was easily rebuffed today by the big D.C. MAGA Rally crowd, only to return at night, after 99% of the crowd had left, to assault elderly people and families. Police got there, but late. Mayor is not doing her job!
1327828007311073280 2020-11-14 20:17:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ANTIFA SCUM ran for the hills today when they tried attacking the people at the Trump Rally, because those people aggressively fought back. Antifa waited until tonight, when 99% were gone, to attack innocent #MAGA People. DC Police, get going — do your job and don’t hold back!!!
1327811527123103746 2020-11-14 19:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I look forward to Mayor Giuliani spearheading the legal effort to defend OUR RIGHT to FREE and FAIR ELECTIONS! Rudy Giuliani, Joseph diGenova, Victoria Toensing, Sidney Powell, and Jenna Ellis, a truly great team, added to our other wonderful lawyers and representatives!
1327750127679889409 2020-11-14 15:07:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There is tremendous evidence of wide spread voter fraud in that there is irrefutable proof that our Republican poll watchers and observers were not allowed to be present in poll counting rooms. Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and others. Unconstitutional!

1327717223142731779 2020-11-14 12:57:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They wouldn’t let our Poll Watchers and Observers into the Counting Rooms. We win on that alone!

1327715767916392449 2020-11-14 12:51:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The hand recount taking place in Georgia is a waste of time. They are not showing the matching signatures. Call off the recount until they allow the MATCH. Don’t let the Radical Left Dems STEAL THE ELECTION!
1327708998662025216 2020-11-14 12:24:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hundreds of thousands of people showing their support in D.C. They will not stand for a Rigged and Corrupt Election!
1327707126375051267 2020-11-14 12:17:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We will WIN!
1327704841964183552 2020-11-14 12:07:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> People are not going to stand for having this Election stolen from them by a privately owned Radical Left company, Dominion, and many other reasons!

1327638503883235332 2020-11-14 07:44:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....We cannot waste time and can only give to those states that will use the Vaccine immediately. Therefore the New York delay. Many lives to be saved, but we are ready when they are. Stop playing politics!
1327638502280925184 2020-11-14 07:44:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I LOVE NEW YORK! As everyone knows, the Trump Administration has produced a great and safe VACCINE far ahead of schedule. Another Administration would have taken five years. The problem is, @NYGovCuomo said that he will delay using it, and other states WANT IT NOW...

1327633164823617548 2020-11-14 07:23:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congress must now do a Covid Relief Bill. Needs Democrats support. Make it big and focused. Get it done!
1327619654592892931 2020-11-14 06:29:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....What are they trying to hide. They know, and so does everyone else. EXPOSE THE CRIME!
1327619653020110850 2020-11-14 06:29:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Consent Decree signed by the Georgia Secretary of State, with the approval of Governor @BrianKempGA, at the urging of @staceyabrams, makes it impossible to check &amp; match signatures on ballots and envelopes, etc. They knew they were going to cheat. Must expose real signatures!

1327438487537246210 2020-11-13 18:29:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow. This is exactly what happened to us. Great courage by judge!

1329093126238203905 2020-11-18 08:04:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Great State of Michigan, with votes being far greater than the number of people who voted, cannot certify the election. The Democrats cheated big time, and got caught. A Republican WIN!
1329087255168708608 2020-11-18 07:41:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In Detroit, there are FAR MORE VOTES THAN PEOPLE. Nothing can be done to cure that giant scam. I win Michigan!
1329086548093014022 2020-11-18 07:38:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The numbers have not improved, it is still 71% out of balance”, stated Wayne County, Michigan,  Canvassers. “There is widespread irregularities in poll numbers.” There are “more votes than people”. The two harassed patriot Canvassers refuse to sign the papers!
1329075487553974275 2020-11-18 06:54:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THEY WOULD’NT LET REPUBLICAN POLL WATCHERS INTO THE COUNTING ROOMS. UNCONSTITUTIONAL!!!
1329069814195871744 2020-11-18 06:31:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Georgia recount is a joke and is being done UNDER PROTEST. Even though thousands of fraudulent votes have been found, the real number is in matching signatures. Governor must open up the unconstitutional Consent Decree and call in the Legislature!
1329065945160175616 2020-11-18 06:16:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They didn’t even allow Republican Observers into the building to watch. A terrible insult to our Constitution!
1329064787142172673 2020-11-18 06:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This was a rigged election. No Republican Poll Watchers allowed, voting machine “glitches” all over the place (meaning they got caught cheating!), voting after election ended, and so much more!
1329060562442067969 2020-11-18 05:55:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wrong! At first they voted against because there were far more VOTES than PEOPLE (Sad!). Then they were threatened, screamed at and viciously harassed, and were FORCED to change their vote, but then REFUSED, as American patriots, to sign the documents. 71% MESS. Don’t Harass!
1329054683441278977 2020-11-18 05:31:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...AND I WON THE ELECTION. VOTER FRAUD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY!
1329050677541281795 2020-11-18 05:15:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Trump votes.
1328900747497525248 2020-11-17 19:20:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Governor Kemp will hopefully see the light before it is too late. Must finally take charge! Two GREAT Senators, who do so much for Georgia and truly love the USA, are in a must win battle with two incompetents who don’t have a clue!
1328886891765182466 2020-11-17 18:24:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Well, it’s really quite simple. You just can’t have more votes than people!
1328886157246156801 2020-11-17 18:22:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> More votes than people, and that is the least of it!!!
1328885313729687553 2020-11-17 18:18:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Flip Michigan back to TRUMP. Detroit, not surprisingly, has tremendous problems!
1328883405837258753 2020-11-17 18:11:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Michigan just refused to certify the election results! Having courage is a beautiful thing. The USA stands proud!

1328856932011167744 2020-11-17 16:25:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The only thing secure about our 2020 Election was that it was virtually impenetrable by foreign powers. On that, the Trump Administration takes great credit. Unfortunately, the Radical Left Democrats, Dominion, and others, were perhaps more successful!
1328853928025403394 2020-11-17 16:14:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THANK YOU!  https://t.co/DrtsiD71i4

1328483862490574849 2020-11-16 15:43:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Big victory moments ago in the State of Nevada. The all Democrat County Commissioner race, on same ballot as President, just thrown out because of large scale voter discrepancy. Clark County officials do not have confidence in their own election security. Major impact!
1328448530504163329 2020-11-16 13:23:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The rate of rejected Mail-In Ballots is 30 X’s lower in Pennsylvania this year than it was in 2016. This is why they kept our poll watchers and observers out of the “SACRED” vote counting rooms!  https://t.co/QPlzfimbd4
1328382287331856384 2020-11-16 08:59:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Georgia won’t let us look at the all important signature match. Without that the recount is MEANINGLESS. Open up unconstitutional Consent Decree, NOW! @BrianKempGA

1328338241284616193 2020-11-16 06:04:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake recount going on in Georgia means nothing because they are not allowing signatures to be looked at and verified. Break the unconstitutional Consent Decree!

The World is watching!

From large numbers of Poll Watchers that were thrown out of vote counting rooms in many of our States, to millions of ballots that have been altered by Democrats, only for Democrats, to voting after the Election was over, to using Radical Left
1328152462331699202 2020-11-15 17:46:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why does the Fake News Media continuously assume that Joe Biden will ascend to the Presidency, not even allowing our side to show, which we are just getting ready to do, how badly shattered and violated our great Constitution has been in the 2020 Election. It was attacked,..
1328137498069970947 2020-11-15 16:47:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A great launch! @NASA was a closed up disaster when we took over. Now it is again the “hottest”, most advanced, space center in the world, by far!
1328100945570500608 2020-11-15 14:21:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Many of the court cases being filed all over the Country are not ours, but rather those of people that have seen horrible abuses. Our big cases showing the unconstitutionality of the 2020 Election, &amp; the outrage of things that were done to change the outcome, will soon be filed!

1328055196904251397 2020-11-15 11:20:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> John Bolton was one of the dumbest people in government that I’ve had the “pleasure” to work with.

1327989713786036227 2020-11-15 06:59:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Rudy will be interviewed by @MariaBartiromo at 10:00 A.M. NOW!
1327988661418340353 2020-11-15 06:55:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Progress!
1327979630477922304 2020-11-15 06:19:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!
1327978710809661440 2020-11-15 06:16:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> RIGGED ELECTION. WE WILL WIN!
1327960545929072645 2020-11-15 05:04:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Watch @RudyGiuliani interview on @MariaBartiromo this morning at 10:00. Doing a great job exposing the Rigged Election Hoax!
1327958640309972992 2020-11-15 04:56:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> All of the mechanical “glitches” that took place on Election Night were really THEM getting caught trying to steal votes. They succeeded plenty, however, without getting caught. Mail-in elections are a sick joke!
1327956491056279552 2020-11-15 04:47:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He won because the Election was Rigged. NO VOTE WATCHERS OR OBSERVERS allowed, vote tabulated by a Radical Left privately owned company, Dominion, with a bad reputation &amp; bum equipment that couldn’t even qualify for Texas (which I won by a lot!), the Fake &amp; Silent Media, &amp; more!
1327950785959915520 2020-11-15 04:25:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is why @FoxNews daytime and weekend daytime have lost their ratings. They are abysmal having @alfredenewman1 (Mayor Pete of Indiana’s most unsuccessful city, by far!) on more than Republicans. Many great alternatives are forming &amp; exist. Try @OANN &amp; @newsmax, among others!
1327840594127974401 2020-11-14 21:07:22 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Tax filings reveal Biden cancer charity spent millions on salaries, zero on research  https://t.co/2DhE1Ddt6y via @nypost
1327840088731029504 2020-11-14 21:05:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mark, but the Fake News Media will never say it!
1327838908089069568 2020-11-14 21:00:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News Media hardly even discussed the tens of thousands of people that came to D.C. Formed organically, and in many parts of the Country!
1327837956820914178 2020-11-14 20:56:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mollie. The Free and Fair Press is gone in our country. They only write about what they want to write about. SUPPRESSION!
1327836670742450177 2020-11-14 20:51:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Silent Media is the Enemy of the People!!!
1327834542707793921 2020-11-14 20:43:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Radical Left ANTIFA SCUM was easily rebuffed today by the big D.C. MAGA Rally crowd, only to return at night, after 99% of the crowd had left, to assault elderly people and families. Police got there, but late. Mayor is not doing her job!
1327828007311073280 2020-11-14 20:17:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ANTIFA SCUM ran for the hills today when they tried attacking the people at the Trump Rally, because those people aggressively fought back. Antifa waited until tonight, when 99% were gone, to attack innocent #MAGA People. DC Police, get going — do your job and don’t hold back!!!
1327811527123103746 2020-11-14 19:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I look forward to Mayor Giuliani spearheading the legal effort to defend OUR RIGHT to FREE and FAIR ELECTIONS! Rudy Giuliani, Joseph diGenova, Victoria Toensing, Sidney Powell, and Jenna Ellis, a truly great team, added to our other wonderful lawyers and representatives!
1327750127679889409 2020-11-14 15:07:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There is tremendous evidence of wide spread voter fraud in that there is irrefutable proof that our Republican poll watchers and observers were not allowed to be present in poll counting rooms. Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and others. Unconstitutional!

1327717223142731779 2020-11-14 12:57:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They wouldn’t let our Poll Watchers and Observers into the Counting Rooms. We win on that alone!

1327715767916392449 2020-11-14 12:51:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The hand recount taking place in Georgia is a waste of time. They are not showing the matching signatures. Call off the recount until they allow the MATCH. Don’t let the Radical Left Dems STEAL THE ELECTION!
1327708998662025216 2020-11-14 12:24:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hundreds of thousands of people showing their support in D.C. They will not stand for a Rigged and Corrupt Election!
1327707126375051267 2020-11-14 12:17:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We will WIN!
1327704841964183552 2020-11-14 12:07:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> People are not going to stand for having this Election stolen from them by a privately owned Radical Left company, Dominion, and many other reasons!

1327638503883235332 2020-11-14 07:44:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....We cannot waste time and can only give to those states that will use the Vaccine immediately. Therefore the New York delay. Many lives to be saved, but we are ready when they are. Stop playing politics!
1327638502280925184 2020-11-14 07:44:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I LOVE NEW YORK! As everyone knows, the Trump Administration has produced a great and safe VACCINE far ahead of schedule. Another Administration would have taken five years. The problem is, @NYGovCuomo said that he will delay using it, and other states WANT IT NOW...

1327633164823617548 2020-11-14 07:23:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congress must now do a Covid Relief Bill. Needs Democrats support. Make it big and focused. Get it done!
1327619654592892931 2020-11-14 06:29:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....What are they trying to hide. They know, and so does everyone else. EXPOSE THE CRIME!
1327619653020110850 2020-11-14 06:29:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Consent Decree signed by the Georgia Secretary of State, with the approval of Governor @BrianKempGA, at the urging of @staceyabrams, makes it impossible to check &amp; match signatures on ballots and envelopes, etc. They knew they were going to cheat. Must expose real signatures!

1327438487537246210 2020-11-13 18:29:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow. This is exactly what happened to us. Great courage by judge!

1329093126238203905 2020-11-18 08:04:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Great State of Michigan, with votes being far greater than the number of people who voted, cannot certify the election. The Democrats cheated big time, and got caught. A Republican WIN!
1329087255168708608 2020-11-18 07:41:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In Detroit, there are FAR MORE VOTES THAN PEOPLE. Nothing can be done to cure that giant scam. I win Michigan!
1329086548093014022 2020-11-18 07:38:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The numbers have not improved, it is still 71% out of balance”, stated Wayne County, Michigan,  Canvassers. “There is widespread irregularities in poll numbers.” There are “more votes than people”. The two harassed patriot Canvassers refuse to sign the papers!
1329075487553974275 2020-11-18 06:54:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THEY WOULD’NT LET REPUBLICAN POLL WATCHERS INTO THE COUNTING ROOMS. UNCONSTITUTIONAL!!!
1329069814195871744 2020-11-18 06:31:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Georgia recount is a joke and is being done UNDER PROTEST. Even though thousands of fraudulent votes have been found, the real number is in matching signatures. Governor must open up the unconstitutional Consent Decree and call in the Legislature!
1329065945160175616 2020-11-18 06:16:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They didn’t even allow Republican Observers into the building to watch. A terrible insult to our Constitution!
1329064787142172673 2020-11-18 06:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This was a rigged election. No Republican Poll Watchers allowed, voting machine “glitches” all over the place (meaning they got caught cheating!), voting after election ended, and so much more!
1329060562442067969 2020-11-18 05:55:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wrong! At first they voted against because there were far more VOTES than PEOPLE (Sad!). Then they were threatened, screamed at and viciously harassed, and were FORCED to change their vote, but then REFUSED, as American patriots, to sign the documents. 71% MESS. Don’t Harass!
1329054683441278977 2020-11-18 05:31:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...AND I WON THE ELECTION. VOTER FRAUD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY!
1329050677541281795 2020-11-18 05:15:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Trump votes.
1328900747497525248 2020-11-17 19:20:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Governor Kemp will hopefully see the light before it is too late. Must finally take charge! Two GREAT Senators, who do so much for Georgia and truly love the USA, are in a must win battle with two incompetents who don’t have a clue!
1328886891765182466 2020-11-17 18:24:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Well, it’s really quite simple. You just can’t have more votes than people!
1328886157246156801 2020-11-17 18:22:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> More votes than people, and that is the least of it!!!
1328885313729687553 2020-11-17 18:18:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Flip Michigan back to TRUMP. Detroit, not surprisingly, has tremendous problems!
1328883405837258753 2020-11-17 18:11:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Michigan just refused to certify the election results! Having courage is a beautiful thing. The USA stands proud!

1328856932011167744 2020-11-17 16:25:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The only thing secure about our 2020 Election was that it was virtually impenetrable by foreign powers. On that, the Trump Administration takes great credit. Unfortunately, the Radical Left Democrats, Dominion, and others, were perhaps more successful!
1328853928025403394 2020-11-17 16:14:00 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THANK YOU!  https://t.co/DrtsiD71i4

1328483862490574849 2020-11-16 15:43:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Big victory moments ago in the State of Nevada. The all Democrat County Commissioner race, on same ballot as President, just thrown out because of large scale voter discrepancy. Clark County officials do not have confidence in their own election security. Major impact!
1328448530504163329 2020-11-16 13:23:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The rate of rejected Mail-In Ballots is 30 X’s lower in Pennsylvania this year than it was in 2016. This is why they kept our poll watchers and observers out of the “SACRED” vote counting rooms!  https://t.co/QPlzfimbd4
1328382287331856384 2020-11-16 08:59:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Georgia won’t let us look at the all important signature match. Without that the recount is MEANINGLESS. Open up unconstitutional Consent Decree, NOW! @BrianKempGA

1328338630679597056 2020-11-16 06:06:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Try watching @OANN. Really GREAT!
1328338241284616193 2020-11-16 06:04:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake recount going on in Georgia means nothing because they are not allowing signatures to be looked at and verified. Break the unconstitutional Consent Decree!

1328324377168015360 2020-11-16 05:09:45 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Washington Post forgot to read the complaint. Fake News. Poll Watchers, and the way they were treated, are a very big deal in the complaint!

1328152466752491526 2020-11-15 17:46:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....owned Dominion Voting Systems, turned down by Texas and many others because it was not good or secure, those responsible for the safeguarding of our Constitution cannot allow the Fake results of the 2020 Mail-In Election to stand. The World is watching!
1328152465016020993 2020-11-15 17:46:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....perhaps like never before! From large numbers of Poll Watchers that were thrown out of vote counting rooms in many of our States, to millions of ballots that have been altered by Democrats, only for Democrats, to voting after the Election was over, to using Radical Left
1328152462331699202 2020-11-15 17:46:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why does the Fake News Media continuously assume that Joe Biden will ascend to the Presidency, not even allowing our side to show, which we are just getting ready to do, how badly shattered and violated our great Constitution has been in the 2020 Election. It was attacked,..
1328137498069970947 2020-11-15 16:47:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A great launch! @NASA was a closed up disaster when we took over. Now it is again the “hottest”, most advanced, space center in the world, by far!
1328100945570500608 2020-11-15 14:21:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Many of the court cases being filed all over the Country are not ours, but rather those of people that have seen horrible abuses. Our big cases showing the unconstitutionality of the 2020 Election, &amp; the outrage of things that were done to change the outcome, will soon be filed!

1328055196904251397 2020-11-15 11:20:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> John Bolton was one of the dumbest people in government that I’ve had the “pleasure” to work with. A sullen, dull and quiet guy, he added nothing to National Security except, “Gee, let’s go to war.” Also, illegally released much Classified Information. A real dope!

1327989713786036227 2020-11-15 06:59:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Rudy will be interviewed by @MariaBartiromo at 10:00 A.M. NOW!
1327988661418340353 2020-11-15 06:55:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Progress!
1327979630477922304 2020-11-15 06:19:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!
1327978710809661440 2020-11-15 06:16:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> RIGGED ELECTION. WE WILL WIN!
1327960545929072645 2020-11-15 05:04:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Watch @RudyGiuliani interview on @MariaBartiromo this morning at 10:00. Doing a great job exposing the Rigged Election Hoax!
1327958640309972992 2020-11-15 04:56:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> All of the mechanical “glitches” that took place on Election Night were really THEM getting caught trying to steal votes. They succeeded plenty, however, without getting caught. Mail-in elections are a sick joke!
1327956491056279552 2020-11-15 04:47:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He won because the Election was Rigged. NO VOTE WATCHERS OR OBSERVERS allowed, vote tabulated by a Radical Left privately owned company, Dominion, with a bad reputation &amp; bum equipment that couldn’t even qualify for Texas (which I won by a lot!), the Fake &amp; Silent Media, &amp; more!
1327950785959915520 2020-11-15 04:25:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is why @FoxNews daytime and weekend daytime have lost their ratings. They are abysmal having @alfredenewman1 (Mayor Pete of Indiana’s most unsuccessful city, by far!) on more than Republicans. Many great alternatives are forming &amp; exist. Try @OANN &amp; @newsmax, among others!

1327840088731029504 2020-11-14 21:05:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mark, but the Fake News Media will never say it!
1327838908089069568 2020-11-14 21:00:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News Media hardly even discussed the tens of thousands of people that came to D.C. Formed organically, and in many parts of the Country!
1327837956820914178 2020-11-14 20:56:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mollie. The Free and Fair Press is gone in our country. They only write about what they want to write about. SUPPRESSION!
1327836670742450177 2020-11-14 20:51:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Silent Media is the Enemy of the People!!!
1327834542707793921 2020-11-14 20:43:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Radical Left ANTIFA SCUM was easily rebuffed today by the big D.C. MAGA Rally crowd, only to return at night, after 99% of the crowd had left, to assault elderly people and families. Police got there, but late. Mayor is not doing her job!
1327828007311073280 2020-11-14 20:17:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ANTIFA SCUM ran for the hills today when they tried attacking the people at the Trump Rally, because those people aggressively fought back. Antifa waited until tonight, when 99% were gone, to attack innocent #MAGA People. DC Police, get going — do your job and don’t hold back!!!
1327811527123103746 2020-11-14 19:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I look forward to Mayor Giuliani spearheading the legal effort to defend OUR RIGHT to FREE and FAIR ELECTIONS! Rudy Giuliani, Joseph diGenova, Victoria Toensing, Sidney Powell, and Jenna Ellis, a truly great team, added to our other wonderful lawyers and representatives!
1327750127679889409 2020-11-14 15:07:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There is tremendous evidence of wide spread voter fraud in that there is irrefutable proof that our Republican poll watchers and observers were not allowed to be present in poll counting rooms. Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and others. Unconstitutional!

1327717223142731779 2020-11-14 12:57:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They wouldn’t let our Poll Watchers and Observers into the Counting Rooms. We win on that alone!

1327715767916392449 2020-11-14 12:51:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The hand recount taking place in Georgia is a waste of time. They are not showing the matching signatures. Call off the recount until they allow the MATCH. Don’t let the Radical Left Dems STEAL THE ELECTION!
1327708998662025216 2020-11-14 12:24:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hundreds of thousands of people showing their support in D.C. They will not stand for a Rigged and Corrupt Election!

1327704841964183552 2020-11-14 12:07:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> People are not going to stand for having this Election stolen from them by a privately owned Radical Left company, Dominion, and many other reasons!

1327638503883235332 2020-11-14 07:44:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....We cannot waste time and can only give to those states that will use the Vaccine immediately. Therefore the New York delay. Many lives to be saved, but we are ready when they are. Stop playing politics!
1327638502280925184 2020-11-14 07:44:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I LOVE NEW YORK! As everyone knows, the Trump Administration has produced a great and safe VACCINE far ahead of schedule. Another Administration would have taken five years. The problem is, @NYGovCuomo said that he will delay using it, and other states WANT IT NOW...

1327619654592892931 2020-11-14 06:29:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....What are they trying to hide. They know, and so does everyone else. EXPOSE THE CRIME!
1327619653020110850 2020-11-14 06:29:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Consent Decree signed by the Georgia Secretary of State, with the approval of Governor @BrianKempGA, at the urging of @staceyabrams, makes it impossible to check &amp; match signatures on ballots and envelopes, etc. They knew they were going to cheat. Must expose real signatures!

1327438487537246210 2020-11-13 18:29:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow. This is exactly what happened to us. Great courage by judge!

1329093126238203905 2020-11-18 08:04:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Great State of Michigan, with votes being far greater than the number of people who voted, cannot certify the election. The Democrats cheated big time, and got caught. A Republican WIN!
1329087255168708608 2020-11-18 07:41:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In Detroit, there are FAR MORE VOTES THAN PEOPLE. Nothing can be done to cure that giant scam. I win Michigan!
1329086548093014022 2020-11-18 07:38:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The numbers have not improved, it is still 71% out of balance”, stated Wayne County, Michigan,  Canvassers. “There is widespread irregularities in poll numbers.” There are “more votes than people”. The two harassed patriot Canvassers refuse to sign the papers!
1329075487553974275 2020-11-18 06:54:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THEY WOULD’NT LET REPUBLICAN POLL WATCHERS INTO THE COUNTING ROOMS. UNCONSTITUTIONAL!!!
1329069814195871744 2020-11-18 06:31:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Georgia recount is a joke and is being done UNDER PROTEST. Even though thousands of fraudulent votes have been found, the real number is in matching signatures. Governor must open up the unconstitutional Consent Decree and call in the Legislature!
1329065945160175616 2020-11-18 06:16:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They didn’t even allow Republican Observers into the building to watch. A terrible insult to our Constitution!
1329064787142172673 2020-11-18 06:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This was a rigged election. No Republican Poll Watchers allowed, voting machine “glitches” all over the place (meaning they got caught cheating!), voting after election ended, and so much more!
1329060562442067969 2020-11-18 05:55:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wrong! At first they voted against because there were far more VOTES than PEOPLE (Sad!). Then they were threatened, screamed at and viciously harassed, and were FORCED to change their vote, but then REFUSED, as American patriots, to sign the documents. 71% MESS. Don’t Harass!
1329054683441278977 2020-11-18 05:31:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...AND I WON THE ELECTION. VOTER FRAUD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY!

1328900747497525248 2020-11-17 19:20:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Governor Kemp will hopefully see the light before it is too late. Must finally take charge! Two GREAT Senators, who do so much for Georgia and truly love the USA, are in a must win battle with two incompetents who don’t have a clue!
1328886891765182466 2020-11-17 18:24:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Well, it’s really quite simple. You just can’t have more votes than people!
1328886157246156801 2020-11-17 18:22:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> More votes than people, and that is the least of it!!!
1328885313729687553 2020-11-17 18:18:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Flip Michigan back to TRUMP. Detroit, not surprisingly, has tremendous problems!
1328883405837258753 2020-11-17 18:11:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Michigan just refused to certify the election results! Having courage is a beautiful thing. The USA stands proud!

1328856932011167744 2020-11-17 16:25:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The only thing secure about our 2020 Election was that it was virtually impenetrable by foreign powers. On that, the Trump Administration takes great credit. Unfortunately, the Radical Left Democrats, Dominion, and others, were perhaps more successful!

The all Democrat County Commissioner race, on same ballot as President, just thrown out because of large scale voter discrepancy. Clark County officials do not have confidence in their own election security. Major impact!
1328448530504163329 2020-11-16 13:23:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The rate of rejected Mail-In Ballots is 30 X’s lower in Pennsylvania this year than it was in 2016. This is why they kept our poll watchers and observers out of the “SACRED” vote counting rooms!  https://t.co/QPlzfimbd4
1328382287331856384 2020-11-16 08:59:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Georgia won’t let us look at the all important signature match. Without that the recount is MEANINGLESS. Open up unconstitutional Consent Decree, NOW! @BrianKempGA

1328338241284616193 2020-11-16 06:04:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake recount going on in Georgia means nothing because they are not allowing signatures to be looked at and verified. Break the unconstitutional Consent Decree!

From large numbers of Poll Watchers that were thrown out of vote counting rooms in many of our States, to millions of ballots that have been altered by Democrats, only for Democrats, to voting after the Election was over, to using Radical Left
1328152462331699202 2020-11-15 17:46:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why does the Fake News Media continuously assume that Joe Biden will ascend to the Presidency, not even allowing our side to show, which we are just getting ready to do, how badly shattered and violated our great Constitution has been in the 2020 Election. It was attacked,..

1328057941203836930 2020-11-15 11:31:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great job Emily!
1328055196904251397 2020-11-15 11:20:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> John Bolton was one of the dumbest people in government that I’ve had the “pleasure” to work with. A sullen, dull and quiet guy, he added nothing to National Security except, “Gee, let’s go to war.” Also, illegally released much Classified Information. A real dope!

1327989713786036227 2020-11-15 06:59:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Rudy will be interviewed by @MariaBartiromo at 10:00 A.M. NOW!
1327988661418340353 2020-11-15 06:55:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Progress!
1327979630477922304 2020-11-15 06:19:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!
1327978710809661440 2020-11-15 06:16:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> RIGGED ELECTION. WE WILL WIN!
1327960545929072645 2020-11-15 05:04:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Watch @RudyGiuliani interview on @MariaBartiromo this morning at 10:00. Doing a great job exposing the Rigged Election Hoax!
1327958640309972992 2020-11-15 04:56:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> All of the mechanical “glitches” that took place on Election Night were really THEM getting caught trying to steal votes. They succeeded plenty, however, without getting caught. Mail-in elections are a sick joke!
1327956491056279552 2020-11-15 04:47:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He won because the Election was Rigged. NO VOTE WATCHERS OR OBSERVERS allowed, vote tabulated by a Radical Left privately owned company, Dominion, with a bad reputation &amp; bum equipment that couldn’t even qualify for Texas (which I won by a lot!), the Fake &amp; Silent Media, &amp; more!
1327950785959915520 2020-11-15 04:25:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is why @FoxNews daytime and weekend daytime have lost their ratings. They are abysmal having @alfredenewman1 (Mayor Pete of Indiana’s most unsuccessful city, by far!) on more than Republicans. Many great alternatives are forming &amp; exist. Try @OANN &amp; @newsmax, among others!

1327840088731029504 2020-11-14 21:05:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mark, but the Fake News Media will never say it!
1327838908089069568 2020-11-14 21:00:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News Media hardly even discussed the tens of thousands of people that came to D.C. Formed organically, and in many parts of the Country!
1327837956820914178 2020-11-14 20:56:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mollie. The Free and Fair Press is gone in our country. They only write about what they want to write about. SUPPRESSION!
1327836670742450177 2020-11-14 20:51:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Silent Media is the Enemy of the People!!!
1327834542707793921 2020-11-14 20:43:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Radical Left ANTIFA SCUM was easily rebuffed today by the big D.C. MAGA Rally crowd, only to return at night, after 99% of the crowd had left, to assault elderly people and families. Police got there, but late. Mayor is not doing her job!
1327828007311073280 2020-11-14 20:17:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ANTIFA SCUM ran for the hills today when they tried attacking the people at the Trump Rally, because those people aggressively fought back. Antifa waited until tonight, when 99% were gone, to attack innocent #MAGA People. DC Police, get going — do your job and don’t hold back!!!
1327811527123103746 2020-11-14 19:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I look forward to Mayor Giuliani spearheading the legal effort to defend OUR RIGHT to FREE and FAIR ELECTIONS! Rudy Giuliani, Joseph diGenova, Victoria Toensing, Sidney Powell, and Jenna Ellis, a truly great team, added to our other wonderful lawyers and representatives!
1327750127679889409 2020-11-14 15:07:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There is tremendous evidence of wide spread voter fraud in that there is irrefutable proof that our Republican poll watchers and observers were not allowed to be present in poll counting rooms. Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and others. Unconstitutional!

1327717223142731779 2020-11-14 12:57:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They wouldn’t let our Poll Watchers and Observers into the Counting Rooms. We win on that alone!

1327715767916392449 2020-11-14 12:51:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The hand recount taking place in Georgia is a waste of time. They are not showing the matching signatures. Call off the recount until they allow the MATCH. Don’t let the Radical Left Dems STEAL THE ELECTION!
1327708998662025216 2020-11-14 12:24:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hundreds of thousands of people showing their support in D.C. They will not stand for a Rigged and Corrupt Election!
1327707126375051267 2020-11-14 12:17:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We will WIN!
1327704841964183552 2020-11-14 12:07:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> People are not going to stand for having this Election stolen from them by a privately owned Radical Left company, Dominion, and many other reasons!

1327638503883235332 2020-11-14 07:44:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....We cannot waste time and can only give to those states that will use the Vaccine immediately. Therefore the New York delay. Many lives to be saved, but we are ready when they are. Stop playing politics!
1327638502280925184 2020-11-14 07:44:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I LOVE NEW YORK! As everyone knows, the Trump Administration has produced a great and safe VACCINE far ahead of schedule. Another Administration would have taken five years. The problem is, @NYGovCuomo said that he will delay using it, and other states WANT IT NOW...

1327633164823617548 2020-11-14 07:23:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congress must now do a Covid Relief Bill. Needs Democrats support. Make it big and focused. Get it done!
1327619654592892931 2020-11-14 06:29:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....What are they trying to hide. They know, and so does everyone else. EXPOSE THE CRIME!
1327619653020110850 2020-11-14 06:29:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Consent Decree signed by the Georgia Secretary of State, with the approval of Governor @BrianKempGA, at the urging of @staceyabrams, makes it impossible to check &amp; match signatures on ballots and envelopes, etc. They knew they were going to cheat. Must expose real signatures!

1327438487537246210 2020-11-13 18:29:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow. This is exactly what happened to us. Great courage by judge!

1329093126238203905 2020-11-18 08:04:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Great State of Michigan, with votes being far greater than the number of people who voted, cannot certify the election. The Democrats cheated big time, and got caught. A Republican WIN!
1329087255168708608 2020-11-18 07:41:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In Detroit, there are FAR MORE VOTES THAN PEOPLE. Nothing can be done to cure that giant scam. I win Michigan!
1329086548093014022 2020-11-18 07:38:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The numbers have not improved, it is still 71% out of balance”, stated Wayne County, Michigan,  Canvassers. “There is widespread irregularities in poll numbers.” There are “more votes than people”. The two harassed patriot Canvassers refuse to sign the papers!
1329075487553974275 2020-11-18 06:54:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THEY WOULD’NT LET REPUBLICAN POLL WATCHERS INTO THE COUNTING ROOMS. UNCONSTITUTIONAL!!!
1329069814195871744 2020-11-18 06:31:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Georgia recount is a joke and is being done UNDER PROTEST. Even though thousands of fraudulent votes have been found, the real number is in matching signatures. Governor must open up the unconstitutional Consent Decree and call in the Legislature!
1329065945160175616 2020-11-18 06:16:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They didn’t even allow Republican Observers into the building to watch. A terrible insult to our Constitution!
1329064787142172673 2020-11-18 06:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This was a rigged election. No Republican Poll Watchers allowed, voting machine “glitches” all over the place (meaning they got caught cheating!), voting after election ended, and so much more!
1329060562442067969 2020-11-18 05:55:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wrong! At first they voted against because there were far more VOTES than PEOPLE (Sad!). Then they were threatened, screamed at and viciously harassed, and were FORCED to change their vote, but then REFUSED, as American patriots, to sign the documents. 71% MESS. Don’t Harass!
1329054683441278977 2020-11-18 05:31:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...AND I WON THE ELECTION. VOTER FRAUD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY!
1329050677541281795 2020-11-18 05:15:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Trump votes.
1328900747497525248 2020-11-17 19:20:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Governor Kemp will hopefully see the light before it is too late. Must finally take charge! Two GREAT Senators, who do so much for Georgia and truly love the USA, are in a must win battle with two incompetents who don’t have a clue!
1328886891765182466 2020-11-17 18:24:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Well, it’s really quite simple. You just can’t have more votes than people!
1328886157246156801 2020-11-17 18:22:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> More votes than people, and that is the least of it!!!
1328885313729687553 2020-11-17 18:18:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Flip Michigan back to TRUMP. Detroit, not surprisingly, has tremendous problems!
1328883405837258753 2020-11-17 18:11:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Michigan just refused to certify the election results! Having courage is a beautiful thing. The USA stands proud!

1328856932011167744 2020-11-17 16:25:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The only thing secure about our 2020 Election was that it was virtually impenetrable by foreign powers. On that, the Trump Administration takes great credit. Unfortunately, the Radical Left Democrats, Dominion, and others, were perhaps more successful!

1328483862490574849 2020-11-16 15:43:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Big victory moments ago in the State of Nevada. The all Democrat County Commissioner race, on same ballot as President, just thrown out because of large scale voter discrepancy. Clark County officials do not have confidence in their own election security. Major impact!
1328448530504163329 2020-11-16 13:23:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The rate of rejected Mail-In Ballots is 30 X’s lower in Pennsylvania this year than it was in 2016. This is why they kept our poll watchers and observers out of the “SACRED” vote counting rooms!  https://t.co/QPlzfimbd4
1328382287331856384 2020-11-16 08:59:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Georgia won’t let us look at the all important signature match. Without that the recount is MEANINGLESS. Open up unconstitutional Consent Decree, NOW! @BrianKempGA

1328338630679597056 2020-11-16 06:06:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Try watching @OANN. Really GREAT!
1328338241284616193 2020-11-16 06:04:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake recount going on in Georgia means nothing because they are not allowing signatures to be looked at and verified. Break the unconstitutional Consent Decree!

1328324377168015360 2020-11-16 05:09:45 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Washington Post forgot to read the complaint. Fake News. Poll Watchers, and the way they were treated, are a very big deal in the complaint!
1328200072987893762 2020-11-15 20:55:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I WON THE ELECTION!
1328152466752491526 2020-11-15 17:46:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....owned Dominion Voting Systems, turned down by Texas and many others because it was not good or secure, those responsible for the safeguarding of our Constitution cannot allow the Fake results of the 2020 Mail-In Election to stand. The World is watching!
1328152465016020993 2020-11-15 17:46:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....perhaps like never before! From large numbers of Poll Watchers that were thrown out of vote counting rooms in many of our States, to millions of ballots that have been altered by Democrats, only for Democrats, to voting after the Election was over, to using Radical Left
1328152462331699202 2020-11-15 17:46:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why does the Fake News Media continuously assume that Joe Biden will ascend to the Presidency, not even allowing our side to show, which we are just getting ready to do, how badly shattered and violated our great Constitution has been in the 2020 Election. It was attacked,..
1328137498069970947 2020-11-15 16:47:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A great launch! @NASA was a closed up disaster when we took over. Now it is again the “hottest”, most advanced, space center in the world, by far!
1328100945570500608 2020-11-15 14:21:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Many of the court cases being filed all over the Country are not ours, but rather those of people that have seen horrible abuses. Our big cases showing the unconstitutionality of the 2020 Election, &amp; the outrage of things that were done to change the outcome, will soon be filed!

Cops Direct Trump-Supporters into Gauntlet of Protesters, Do Nothing When They Are Assaulted  https://t.co/179yDCbZou via @BreitbartNews. These thugs and lowlifes only stalked and attacked when most of the tens of thousands of people had left town. Ran away earlier!
1328057941203836930 2020-11-15 11:31:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great job Emily!
1328055196904251397 2020-11-15 11:20:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> John Bolton was one of the dumbest people in government that I’ve had the “pleasure” to work with. A sullen, dull and quiet guy, he added nothing to National Security except, “Gee, let’s go to war.” Also, illegally released much Classified Information. A real dope!

1327988661418340353 2020-11-15 06:55:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Progress!
1327979630477922304 2020-11-15 06:19:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!
1327978710809661440 2020-11-15 06:16:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> RIGGED ELECTION. WE WILL WIN!
1327960545929072645 2020-11-15 05:04:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Watch @RudyGiuliani interview on @MariaBartiromo this morning at 10:00. Doing a great job exposing the Rigged Election Hoax!
1327958640309972992 2020-11-15 04:56:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> All of the mechanical “glitches” that took place on Election Night were really THEM getting caught trying to steal votes. They succeeded plenty, however, without getting caught. Mail-in elections are a sick joke!
1327956491056279552 2020-11-15 04:47:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He won because the Election was Rigged. NO VOTE WATCHERS OR OBSERVERS allowed, vote tabulated by a Radical Left privately owned company, Dominion, with a bad reputation &amp; bum equipment that couldn’t even qualify for Texas (which I won by a lot!), the Fake &amp; Silent Media, &amp; more!
1327950785959915520 2020-11-15 04:25:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is why @FoxNews daytime and weekend daytime have lost their ratings. They are abysmal having @alfredenewman1 (Mayor Pete of Indiana’s most unsuccessful city, by far!) on more than Republicans. Many great alternatives are forming &amp; exist. Try @OANN &amp; @newsmax, among others!

1327840088731029504 2020-11-14 21:05:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mark, but the Fake News Media will never say it!
1327838908089069568 2020-11-14 21:00:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News Media hardly even discussed the tens of thousands of people that came to D.C. Formed organically, and in many parts of the Country!
1327837956820914178 2020-11-14 20:56:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mollie. The Free and Fair Press is gone in our country. They only write about what they want to write about. SUPPRESSION!
1327836670742450177 2020-11-14 20:51:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Silent Media is the Enemy of the People!!!
1327834542707793921 2020-11-14 20:43:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Radical Left ANTIFA SCUM was easily rebuffed today by the big D.C. MAGA Rally crowd, only to return at night, after 99% of the crowd had left, to assault elderly people and families. Police got there, but late. Mayor is not doing her job!
1327828007311073280 2020-11-14 20:17:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ANTIFA SCUM ran for the hills today when they tried attacking the people at the Trump Rally, because those people aggressively fought back. Antifa waited until tonight, when 99% were gone, to attack innocent #MAGA People. DC Police, get going — do your job and don’t hold back!!!
1327811527123103746 2020-11-14 19:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I look forward to Mayor Giuliani spearheading the legal effort to defend OUR RIGHT to FREE and FAIR ELECTIONS! Rudy Giuliani, Joseph diGenova, Victoria Toensing, Sidney Powell, and Jenna Ellis, a truly great team, added to our other wonderful lawyers and representatives!
1327750127679889409 2020-11-14 15:07:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There is tremendous evidence of wide spread voter fraud in that there is irrefutable proof that our Republican poll watchers and observers were not allowed to be present in poll counting rooms. Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and others. Unconstitutional!

1327717223142731779 2020-11-14 12:57:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They wouldn’t let our Poll Watchers and Observers into the Counting Rooms. We win on that alone!

1327715767916392449 2020-11-14 12:51:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The hand recount taking place in Georgia is a waste of time. They are not showing the matching signatures. Call off the recount until they allow the MATCH. Don’t let the Radical Left Dems STEAL THE ELECTION!
1327708998662025216 2020-11-14 12:24:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hundreds of thousands of people showing their support in D.C. They will not stand for a Rigged and Corrupt Election!

1327704841964183552 2020-11-14 12:07:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> People are not going to stand for having this Election stolen from them by a privately owned Radical Left company, Dominion, and many other reasons!

1327638502280925184 2020-11-14 07:44:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I LOVE NEW YORK! As everyone knows, the Trump Administration has produced a great and safe VACCINE far ahead of schedule. Another Administration would have taken five years. The problem is, @NYGovCuomo said that he will delay using it, and other states WANT IT NOW...

1327619654592892931 2020-11-14 06:29:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....What are they trying to hide. They know, and so does everyone else. EXPOSE THE CRIME!
1327619653020110850 2020-11-14 06:29:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Consent Decree signed by the Georgia Secretary of State, with the approval of Governor @BrianKempGA, at the urging of @staceyabrams, makes it impossible to check &amp; match signatures on ballots and envelopes, etc. They knew they were going to cheat. Must expose real signatures!

1329093126238203905 2020-11-18 08:04:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Great State of Michigan, with votes being far greater than the number of people who voted, cannot certify the election. The Democrats cheated big time, and got caught. A Republican WIN!
1329087255168708608 2020-11-18 07:41:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In Detroit, there are FAR MORE VOTES THAN PEOPLE. Nothing can be done to cure that giant scam. I win Michigan!
1329086548093014022 2020-11-18 07:38:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The numbers have not improved, it is still 71% out of balance”, stated Wayne County, Michigan,  Canvassers. “There is widespread irregularities in poll numbers.” There are “more votes than people”. The two harassed patriot Canvassers refuse to sign the papers!
1329075487553974275 2020-11-18 06:54:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THEY WOULD’NT LET REPUBLICAN POLL WATCHERS INTO THE COUNTING ROOMS. UNCONSTITUTIONAL!!!
1329069814195871744 2020-11-18 06:31:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Georgia recount is a joke and is being done UNDER PROTEST. Even though thousands of fraudulent votes have been found, the real number is in matching signatures. Governor must open up the unconstitutional Consent Decree and call in the Legislature!
1329065945160175616 2020-11-18 06:16:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They didn’t even allow Republican Observers into the building to watch. A terrible insult to our Constitution!
1329064787142172673 2020-11-18 06:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This was a rigged election. No Republican Poll Watchers allowed, voting machine “glitches” all over the place (meaning they got caught cheating!), voting after election ended, and so much more!
1329060562442067969 2020-11-18 05:55:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wrong! At first they voted against because there were far more VOTES than PEOPLE (Sad!). Then they were threatened, screamed at and viciously harassed, and were FORCED to change their vote, but then REFUSED, as American patriots, to sign the documents. 71% MESS. Don’t Harass!
1329054683441278977 2020-11-18 05:31:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...AND I WON THE ELECTION. VOTER FRAUD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY!

1328900747497525248 2020-11-17 19:20:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Governor Kemp will hopefully see the light before it is too late. Must finally take charge! Two GREAT Senators, who do so much for Georgia and truly love the USA, are in a must win battle with two incompetents who don’t have a clue!
1328886891765182466 2020-11-17 18:24:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Well, it’s really quite simple. You just can’t have more votes than people!
1328886157246156801 2020-11-17 18:22:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> More votes than people, and that is the least of it!!!
1328885313729687553 2020-11-17 18:18:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Flip Michigan back to TRUMP. Detroit, not surprisingly, has tremendous problems!
1328883405837258753 2020-11-17 18:11:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Michigan just refused to certify the election results! Having courage is a beautiful thing. The USA stands proud!

1328856932011167744 2020-11-17 16:25:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The only thing secure about our 2020 Election was that it was virtually impenetrable by foreign powers. On that, the Trump Administration takes great credit. Unfortunately, the Radical Left Democrats, Dominion, and others, were perhaps more successful!

The all Democrat County Commissioner race, on same ballot as President, just thrown out because of large scale voter discrepancy. Clark County officials do not have confidence in their own election security. Major impact!
1328448530504163329 2020-11-16 13:23:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The rate of rejected Mail-In Ballots is 30 X’s lower in Pennsylvania this year than it was in 2016. This is why they kept our poll watchers and observers out of the “SACRED” vote counting rooms!  https://t.co/QPlzfimbd4
1328382287331856384 2020-11-16 08:59:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Georgia won’t let us look at the all important signature match. Without that the recount is MEANINGLESS. Open up unconstitutional Consent Decree, NOW! @BrianKempGA

1328338241284616193 2020-11-16 06:04:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake recount going on in Georgia means nothing because they are not allowing signatures to be looked at and verified. Break the unconstitutional Consent Decree!

The World is watching!

From large numbers of Poll Watchers that were thrown out of vote counting rooms in many of our States, to millions of ballots that have been altered by Democrats, only for Democrats, to voting after the Election was over, to using Radical Left
1328152462331699202 2020-11-15 17:46:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why does the Fake News Media continuously assume that Joe Biden will ascend to the Presidency, not even allowing our side to show, which we are just getting ready to do, how badly shattered and violated our great Constitution has been in the 2020 Election. It was attacked,..
1328137498069970947 2020-11-15 16:47:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A great launch! @NASA was a closed up disaster when we took over. Now it is again the “hottest”, most advanced, space center in the world, by far!

Our big cases showing the unconstitutionality of the 2020 Election, &amp; the outrage of things that were done to change the outcome, will soon be filed!
1328094310294822917 2020-11-15 13:55:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Spirit like never before!
1328094121295286273 2020-11-15 13:54:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Amazing!
1328093294782509060 2020-11-15 13:51:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We won’t let a RIGGED ELECTION steal our Country!

Cops Direct Trump-Supporters into Gauntlet of Protesters, Do Nothing When They Are Assaulted  https://t.co/179yDCbZou via @BreitbartNews. These thugs and lowlifes only stalked and attacked when most of the tens of thousands of people had left town. Ran away earlier!
1328057941203836930 2020-11-15 11:31:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great job Emily!
1328055196904251397 2020-11-15 11:20:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> John Bolton was one of the dumbest people in government that I’ve had the “pleasure” to work with. A sullen, dull and quiet guy, he added nothing to National Security except, “Gee, let’s go to war.” Also, illegally released much Classified Information. A real dope!

1327989713786036227 2020-11-15 06:59:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Rudy will be interviewed by @MariaBartiromo at 10:00 A.M. NOW!
1327988661418340353 2020-11-15 06:55:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Progress!
1327979630477922304 2020-11-15 06:19:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!
1327978710809661440 2020-11-15 06:16:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> RIGGED ELECTION. WE WILL WIN!
1327960545929072645 2020-11-15 05:04:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Watch @RudyGiuliani interview on @MariaBartiromo this morning at 10:00. Doing a great job exposing the Rigged Election Hoax!
1327958640309972992 2020-11-15 04:56:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> All of the mechanical “glitches” that took place on Election Night were really THEM getting caught trying to steal votes. They succeeded plenty, however, without getting caught. Mail-in elections are a sick joke!
1327956491056279552 2020-11-15 04:47:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He won because the Election was Rigged. NO VOTE WATCHERS OR OBSERVERS allowed, vote tabulated by a Radical Left privately owned company, Dominion, with a bad reputation &amp; bum equipment that couldn’t even qualify for Texas (which I won by a lot!), the Fake &amp; Silent Media, &amp; more!
1327950785959915520 2020-11-15 04:25:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is why @FoxNews daytime and weekend daytime have lost their ratings. They are abysmal having @alfredenewman1 (Mayor Pete of Indiana’s most unsuccessful city, by far!) on more than Republicans. Many great alternatives are forming &amp; exist. Try @OANN &amp; @newsmax, among others!

1327840088731029504 2020-11-14 21:05:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mark, but the Fake News Media will never say it!
1327838908089069568 2020-11-14 21:00:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News Media hardly even discussed the tens of thousands of people that came to D.C. Formed organically, and in many parts of the Country!
1327837956820914178 2020-11-14 20:56:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mollie. The Free and Fair Press is gone in our country. They only write about what they want to write about. SUPPRESSION!
1327836670742450177 2020-11-14 20:51:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Silent Media is the Enemy of the People!!!
1327834542707793921 2020-11-14 20:43:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Radical Left ANTIFA SCUM was easily rebuffed today by the big D.C. MAGA Rally crowd, only to return at night, after 99% of the crowd had left, to assault elderly people and families. Police got there, but late. Mayor is not doing her job!
1327828007311073280 2020-11-14 20:17:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ANTIFA SCUM ran for the hills today when they tried attacking the people at the Trump Rally, because those people aggressively fought back. Antifa waited until tonight, when 99% were gone, to attack innocent #MAGA People. DC Police, get going — do your job and don’t hold back!!!
1327811527123103746 2020-11-14 19:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I look forward to Mayor Giuliani spearheading the legal effort to defend OUR RIGHT to FREE and FAIR ELECTIONS! Rudy Giuliani, Joseph diGenova, Victoria Toensing, Sidney Powell, and Jenna Ellis, a truly great team, added to our other wonderful lawyers and representatives!
1327750127679889409 2020-11-14 15:07:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There is tremendous evidence of wide spread voter fraud in that there is irrefutable proof that our Republican poll watchers and observers were not allowed to be present in poll counting rooms. Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and others. Unconstitutional!

1327717223142731779 2020-11-14 12:57:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They wouldn’t let our Poll Watchers and Observers into the Counting Rooms. We win on that alone!

1327715767916392449 2020-11-14 12:51:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The hand recount taking place in Georgia is a waste of time. They are not showing the matching signatures. Call off the recount until they allow the MATCH. Don’t let the Radical Left Dems STEAL THE ELECTION!
1327708998662025216 2020-11-14 12:24:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hundreds of thousands of people showing their support in D.C. They will not stand for a Rigged and Corrupt Election!

1327704841964183552 2020-11-14 12:07:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> People are not going to stand for having this Election stolen from them by a privately owned Radical Left company, Dominion, and many other reasons!

1327638502280925184 2020-11-14 07:44:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I LOVE NEW YORK! As everyone knows, the Trump Administration has produced a great and safe VACCINE far ahead of schedule. Another Administration would have taken five years. The problem is, @NYGovCuomo said that he will delay using it, and other states WANT IT NOW...

1327619653020110850 2020-11-14 06:29:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Consent Decree signed by the Georgia Secretary of State, with the approval of Governor @BrianKempGA, at the urging of @staceyabrams, makes it impossible to check &amp; match signatures on ballots and envelopes, etc. They knew they were going to cheat. Must expose real signatures!

1329093126238203905 2020-11-18 08:04:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Great State of Michigan, with votes being far greater than the number of people who voted, cannot certify the election. The Democrats cheated big time, and got caught. A Republican WIN!
1329087255168708608 2020-11-18 07:41:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In Detroit, there are FAR MORE VOTES THAN PEOPLE. Nothing can be done to cure that giant scam. I win Michigan!
1329086548093014022 2020-11-18 07:38:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The numbers have not improved, it is still 71% out of balance”, stated Wayne County, Michigan,  Canvassers. “There is widespread irregularities in poll numbers.” There are “more votes than people”. The two harassed patriot Canvassers refuse to sign the papers!
1329075487553974275 2020-11-18 06:54:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THEY WOULD’NT LET REPUBLICAN POLL WATCHERS INTO THE COUNTING ROOMS. UNCONSTITUTIONAL!!!
1329069814195871744 2020-11-18 06:31:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Georgia recount is a joke and is being done UNDER PROTEST. Even though thousands of fraudulent votes have been found, the real number is in matching signatures. Governor must open up the unconstitutional Consent Decree and call in the Legislature!
1329065945160175616 2020-11-18 06:16:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They didn’t even allow Republican Observers into the building to watch. A terrible insult to our Constitution!
1329064787142172673 2020-11-18 06:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This was a rigged election. No Republican Poll Watchers allowed, voting machine “glitches” all over the place (meaning they got caught cheating!), voting after election ended, and so much more!
1329060562442067969 2020-11-18 05:55:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wrong! At first they voted against because there were far more VOTES than PEOPLE (Sad!). Then they were threatened, screamed at and viciously harassed, and were FORCED to change their vote, but then REFUSED, as American patriots, to sign the documents. 71% MESS. Don’t Harass!
1329054683441278977 2020-11-18 05:31:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...AND I WON THE ELECTION. VOTER FRAUD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY!

1328900747497525248 2020-11-17 19:20:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Governor Kemp will hopefully see the light before it is too late. Must finally take charge! Two GREAT Senators, who do so much for Georgia and truly love the USA, are in a must win battle with two incompetents who don’t have a clue!
1328886891765182466 2020-11-17 18:24:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Well, it’s really quite simple. You just can’t have more votes than people!
1328886157246156801 2020-11-17 18:22:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> More votes than people, and that is the least of it!!!
1328885313729687553 2020-11-17 18:18:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Flip Michigan back to TRUMP. Detroit, not surprisingly, has tremendous problems!
1328883405837258753 2020-11-17 18:11:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Michigan just refused to certify the election results! Having courage is a beautiful thing. The USA stands proud!

1328856932011167744 2020-11-17 16:25:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The only thing secure about our 2020 Election was that it was virtually impenetrable by foreign powers. On that, the Trump Administration takes great credit. Unfortunately, the Radical Left Democrats, Dominion, and others, were perhaps more successful!

From large numbers of Poll Watchers that were thrown out of vote counting rooms in many of our States, to millions of ballots that have been altered by Democrats, only for Democrats, to voting after the Election was over, to using Radical Left
1328152462331699202 2020-11-15 17:46:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why does the Fake News Media continuously assume that Joe Biden will ascend to the Presidency, not even allowing our side to show, which we are just getting ready to do, how badly shattered and violated our great Constitution has been in the 2020 Election. It was attacked,..
1328137498069970947 2020-11-15 16:47:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A great launch! @NASA was a closed up disaster when we took over. Now it is again the “hottest”, most advanced, space center in the world, by far!
1328100945570500608 2020-11-15 14:21:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Many of the court cases being filed all over the Country are not ours, but rather those of people that have seen horrible abuses. Our big cases showing the unconstitutionality of the 2020 Election, &amp; the outrage of things that were done to change the outcome, will soon be filed!
1328094310294822917 2020-11-15 13:55:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Spirit like never before!
1328094121295286273 2020-11-15 13:54:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Amazing!
1328093294782509060 2020-11-15 13:51:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We won’t let a RIGGED ELECTION steal our Country!
1328089401008807943 2020-11-15 13:36:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> WATCH: D.C. Cops Direct Trump-Supporters into Gauntlet of Protesters, Do Nothing When They Are Assaulted  https://t.co/179yDCbZou via @BreitbartNews. These thugs and lowlifes only stalked and attacked when most of the tens of thousands of people had left town. Ran away earlier!
1328057941203836930 2020-11-15 11:31:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great job Emily!
1328055196904251397 2020-11-15 11:20:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> John Bolton was one of the dumbest people in government that I’ve had the “pleasure” to work with. A sullen, dull and quiet guy, he added nothing to National Security except, “Gee, let’s go to war.” Also, illegally released much Classified Information. A real dope!

1327989713786036227 2020-11-15 06:59:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Rudy will be interviewed by @MariaBartiromo at 10:00 A.M. NOW!
1327988661418340353 2020-11-15 06:55:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Progress!
1327979630477922304 2020-11-15 06:19:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!
1327978710809661440 2020-11-15 06:16:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> RIGGED ELECTION. WE WILL WIN!
1327960545929072645 2020-11-15 05:04:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Watch @RudyGiuliani interview on @MariaBartiromo this morning at 10:00. Doing a great job exposing the Rigged Election Hoax!
1327958640309972992 2020-11-15 04:56:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> All of the mechanical “glitches” that took place on Election Night were really THEM getting caught trying to steal votes. They succeeded plenty, however, without getting caught. Mail-in elections are a sick joke!
1327956491056279552 2020-11-15 04:47:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He won because the Election was Rigged. NO VOTE WATCHERS OR OBSERVERS allowed, vote tabulated by a Radical Left privately owned company, Dominion, with a bad reputation &amp; bum equipment that couldn’t even qualify for Texas (which I won by a lot!), the Fake &amp; Silent Media, &amp; more!
1327950785959915520 2020-11-15 04:25:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is why @FoxNews daytime and weekend daytime have lost their ratings. They are abysmal having @alfredenewman1 (Mayor Pete of Indiana’s most unsuccessful city, by far!) on more than Republicans. Many great alternatives are forming &amp; exist. Try @OANN &amp; @newsmax, among others!

1327840088731029504 2020-11-14 21:05:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mark, but the Fake News Media will never say it!
1327838908089069568 2020-11-14 21:00:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News Media hardly even discussed the tens of thousands of people that came to D.C. Formed organically, and in many parts of the Country!
1327837956820914178 2020-11-14 20:56:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mollie. The Free and Fair Press is gone in our country. They only write about what they want to write about. SUPPRESSION!
1327836670742450177 2020-11-14 20:51:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Silent Media is the Enemy of the People!!!
1327834542707793921 2020-11-14 20:43:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Radical Left ANTIFA SCUM was easily rebuffed today by the big D.C. MAGA Rally crowd, only to return at night, after 99% of the crowd had left, to assault elderly people and families. Police got there, but late. Mayor is not doing her job!
1327828007311073280 2020-11-14 20:17:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ANTIFA SCUM ran for the hills today when they tried attacking the people at the Trump Rally, because those people aggressively fought back. Antifa waited until tonight, when 99% were gone, to attack innocent #MAGA People. DC Police, get going — do your job and don’t hold back!!!
1327811527123103746 2020-11-14 19:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I look forward to Mayor Giuliani spearheading the legal effort to defend OUR RIGHT to FREE and FAIR ELECTIONS! Rudy Giuliani, Joseph diGenova, Victoria Toensing, Sidney Powell, and Jenna Ellis, a truly great team, added to our other wonderful lawyers and representatives!
1327750127679889409 2020-11-14 15:07:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There is tremendous evidence of wide spread voter fraud in that there is irrefutable proof that our Republican poll watchers and observers were not allowed to be present in poll counting rooms. Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and others. Unconstitutional!

1327717223142731779 2020-11-14 12:57:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They wouldn’t let our Poll Watchers and Observers into the Counting Rooms. We win on that alone!

1327715767916392449 2020-11-14 12:51:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The hand recount taking place in Georgia is a waste of time. They are not showing the matching signatures. Call off the recount until they allow the MATCH. Don’t let the Radical Left Dems STEAL THE ELECTION!
1327708998662025216 2020-11-14 12:24:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hundreds of thousands of people showing their support in D.C. They will not stand for a Rigged and Corrupt Election!
1327707126375051267 2020-11-14 12:17:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We will WIN!
1327704841964183552 2020-11-14 12:07:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> People are not going to stand for having this Election stolen from them by a privately owned Radical Left company, Dominion, and many other reasons!

1327638503883235332 2020-11-14 07:44:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....We cannot waste time and can only give to those states that will use the Vaccine immediately. Therefore the New York delay. Many lives to be saved, but we are ready when they are. Stop playing politics!
1327638502280925184 2020-11-14 07:44:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I LOVE NEW YORK! As everyone knows, the Trump Administration has produced a great and safe VACCINE far ahead of schedule. Another Administration would have taken five years. The problem is, @NYGovCuomo said that he will delay using it, and other states WANT IT NOW...

1327633164823617548 2020-11-14 07:23:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congress must now do a Covid Relief Bill. Needs Democrats support. Make it big and focused. Get it done!
1327619654592892931 2020-11-14 06:29:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....What are they trying to hide. They know, and so does everyone else. EXPOSE THE CRIME!
1327619653020110850 2020-11-14 06:29:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Consent Decree signed by the Georgia Secretary of State, with the approval of Governor @BrianKempGA, at the urging of @staceyabrams, makes it impossible to check &amp; match signatures on ballots and envelopes, etc. They knew they were going to cheat. Must expose real signatures!

1327438487537246210 2020-11-13 18:29:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow. This is exactly what happened to us. Great courage by judge!

1329093126238203905 2020-11-18 08:04:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Great State of Michigan, with votes being far greater than the number of people who voted, cannot certify the election. The Democrats cheated big time, and got caught. A Republican WIN!
1329087255168708608 2020-11-18 07:41:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In Detroit, there are FAR MORE VOTES THAN PEOPLE. Nothing can be done to cure that giant scam. I win Michigan!
1329086548093014022 2020-11-18 07:38:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The numbers have not improved, it is still 71% out of balance”, stated Wayne County, Michigan,  Canvassers. “There is widespread irregularities in poll numbers.” There are “more votes than people”. The two harassed patriot Canvassers refuse to sign the papers!
1329075487553974275 2020-11-18 06:54:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THEY WOULD’NT LET REPUBLICAN POLL WATCHERS INTO THE COUNTING ROOMS. UNCONSTITUTIONAL!!!
1329069814195871744 2020-11-18 06:31:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Georgia recount is a joke and is being done UNDER PROTEST. Even though thousands of fraudulent votes have been found, the real number is in matching signatures. Governor must open up the unconstitutional Consent Decree and call in the Legislature!
1329065945160175616 2020-11-18 06:16:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They didn’t even allow Republican Observers into the building to watch. A terrible insult to our Constitution!
1329064787142172673 2020-11-18 06:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This was a rigged election. No Republican Poll Watchers allowed, voting machine “glitches” all over the place (meaning they got caught cheating!), voting after election ended, and so much more!
1329060562442067969 2020-11-18 05:55:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wrong! At first they voted against because there were far more VOTES than PEOPLE (Sad!). Then they were threatened, screamed at and viciously harassed, and were FORCED to change their vote, but then REFUSED, as American patriots, to sign the documents. 71% MESS. Don’t Harass!
1329054683441278977 2020-11-18 05:31:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...AND I WON THE ELECTION. VOTER FRAUD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY!

1328900747497525248 2020-11-17 19:20:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Governor Kemp will hopefully see the light before it is too late. Must finally take charge! Two GREAT Senators, who do so much for Georgia and truly love the USA, are in a must win battle with two incompetents who don’t have a clue!
1328886891765182466 2020-11-17 18:24:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Well, it’s really quite simple. You just can’t have more votes than people!
1328886157246156801 2020-11-17 18:22:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> More votes than people, and that is the least of it!!!
1328885313729687553 2020-11-17 18:18:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Flip Michigan back to TRUMP. Detroit, not surprisingly, has tremendous problems!
1328883405837258753 2020-11-17 18:11:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Michigan just refused to certify the election results! Having courage is a beautiful thing. The USA stands proud!

1328856932011167744 2020-11-17 16:25:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The only thing secure about our 2020 Election was that it was virtually impenetrable by foreign powers. On that, the Trump Administration takes great credit. Unfortunately, the Radical Left Democrats, Dominion, and others, were perhaps more successful!

From large numbers of Poll Watchers that were thrown out of vote counting rooms in many of our States, to millions of ballots that have been altered by Democrats, only for Democrats, to voting after the Election was over, to using Radical Left
1328152462331699202 2020-11-15 17:46:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why does the Fake News Media continuously assume that Joe Biden will ascend to the Presidency, not even allowing our side to show, which we are just getting ready to do, how badly shattered and violated our great Constitution has been in the 2020 Election. It was attacked,..
1328137498069970947 2020-11-15 16:47:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A great launch! @NASA was a closed up disaster when we took over. Now it is again the “hottest”, most advanced, space center in the world, by far!
1328100945570500608 2020-11-15 14:21:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Many of the court cases being filed all over the Country are not ours, but rather those of people that have seen horrible abuses. Our big cases showing the unconstitutionality of the 2020 Election, &amp; the outrage of things that were done to change the outcome, will soon be filed!
1328094310294822917 2020-11-15 13:55:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Spirit like never before!
1328094121295286273 2020-11-15 13:54:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Amazing!
1328093294782509060 2020-11-15 13:51:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We won’t let a RIGGED ELECTION steal our Country!
1328089401008807943 2020-11-15 13:36:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> WATCH: D.C. Cops Direct Trump-Supporters into Gauntlet of Protesters, Do Nothing When They Are Assaulted  https://t.co/179yDCbZou via @BreitbartNews. These thugs and lowlifes only stalked and attacked when most of the tens of thousands of people had left town. Ran away earlier!
1328057941203836930 2020-11-15 11:31:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great job Emily!
1328055196904251397 2020-11-15 11:20:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> John Bolton was one of the dumbest people in government that I’ve had the “pleasure” to work with. A sullen, dull and quiet guy, he added nothing to National Security except, “Gee, let’s go to war.” Also, illegally released much Classified Information. A real dope!

1327989713786036227 2020-11-15 06:59:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Rudy will be interviewed by @MariaBartiromo at 10:00 A.M. NOW!
1327988661418340353 2020-11-15 06:55:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Progress!
1327979630477922304 2020-11-15 06:19:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!
1327978710809661440 2020-11-15 06:16:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> RIGGED ELECTION. WE WILL WIN!
1327960545929072645 2020-11-15 05:04:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Watch @RudyGiuliani interview on @MariaBartiromo this morning at 10:00. Doing a great job exposing the Rigged Election Hoax!
1327958640309972992 2020-11-15 04:56:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> All of the mechanical “glitches” that took place on Election Night were really THEM getting caught trying to steal votes. They succeeded plenty, however, without getting caught. Mail-in elections are a sick joke!
1327956491056279552 2020-11-15 04:47:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He won because the Election was Rigged. NO VOTE WATCHERS OR OBSERVERS allowed, vote tabulated by a Radical Left privately owned company, Dominion, with a bad reputation &amp; bum equipment that couldn’t even qualify for Texas (which I won by a lot!), the Fake &amp; Silent Media, &amp; more!
1327950785959915520 2020-11-15 04:25:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is why @FoxNews daytime and weekend daytime have lost their ratings. They are abysmal having @alfredenewman1 (Mayor Pete of Indiana’s most unsuccessful city, by far!) on more than Republicans. Many great alternatives are forming &amp; exist. Try @OANN &amp; @newsmax, among others!

1327840088731029504 2020-11-14 21:05:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mark, but the Fake News Media will never say it!
1327838908089069568 2020-11-14 21:00:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News Media hardly even discussed the tens of thousands of people that came to D.C. Formed organically, and in many parts of the Country!
1327837956820914178 2020-11-14 20:56:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mollie. The Free and Fair Press is gone in our country. They only write about what they want to write about. SUPPRESSION!
1327836670742450177 2020-11-14 20:51:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Silent Media is the Enemy of the People!!!
1327834542707793921 2020-11-14 20:43:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Radical Left ANTIFA SCUM was easily rebuffed today by the big D.C. MAGA Rally crowd, only to return at night, after 99% of the crowd had left, to assault elderly people and families. Police got there, but late. Mayor is not doing her job!
1327828007311073280 2020-11-14 20:17:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ANTIFA SCUM ran for the hills today when they tried attacking the people at the Trump Rally, because those people aggressively fought back. Antifa waited until tonight, when 99% were gone, to attack innocent #MAGA People. DC Police, get going — do your job and don’t hold back!!!
1327811527123103746 2020-11-14 19:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I look forward to Mayor Giuliani spearheading the legal effort to defend OUR RIGHT to FREE and FAIR ELECTIONS! Rudy Giuliani, Joseph diGenova, Victoria Toensing, Sidney Powell, and Jenna Ellis, a truly great team, added to our other wonderful lawyers and representatives!
1327750127679889409 2020-11-14 15:07:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There is tremendous evidence of wide spread voter fraud in that there is irrefutable proof that our Republican poll watchers and observers were not allowed to be present in poll counting rooms. Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and others. Unconstitutional!

1327717223142731779 2020-11-14 12:57:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They wouldn’t let our Poll Watchers and Observers into the Counting Rooms. We win on that alone!

1327715767916392449 2020-11-14 12:51:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The hand recount taking place in Georgia is a waste of time. They are not showing the matching signatures. Call off the recount until they allow the MATCH. Don’t let the Radical Left Dems STEAL THE ELECTION!
1327708998662025216 2020-11-14 12:24:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hundreds of thousands of people showing their support in D.C. They will not stand for a Rigged and Corrupt Election!
1327707126375051267 2020-11-14 12:17:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We will WIN!
1327704841964183552 2020-11-14 12:07:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> People are not going to stand for having this Election stolen from them by a privately owned Radical Left company, Dominion, and many other reasons!

1327638503883235332 2020-11-14 07:44:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....We cannot waste time and can only give to those states that will use the Vaccine immediately. Therefore the New York delay. Many lives to be saved, but we are ready when they are. Stop playing politics!
1327638502280925184 2020-11-14 07:44:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I LOVE NEW YORK! As everyone knows, the Trump Administration has produced a great and safe VACCINE far ahead of schedule. Another Administration would have taken five years. The problem is, @NYGovCuomo said that he will delay using it, and other states WANT IT NOW...

1327633164823617548 2020-11-14 07:23:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congress must now do a Covid Relief Bill. Needs Democrats support. Make it big and focused. Get it done!
1327619654592892931 2020-11-14 06:29:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....What are they trying to hide. They know, and so does everyone else. EXPOSE THE CRIME!
1327619653020110850 2020-11-14 06:29:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Consent Decree signed by the Georgia Secretary of State, with the approval of Governor @BrianKempGA, at the urging of @staceyabrams, makes it impossible to check &amp; match signatures on ballots and envelopes, etc. They knew they were going to cheat. Must expose real signatures!

1327438487537246210 2020-11-13 18:29:32 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow. This is exactly what happened to us. Great courage by judge!

1329093126238203905 2020-11-18 08:04:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Great State of Michigan, with votes being far greater than the number of people who voted, cannot certify the election. The Democrats cheated big time, and got caught. A Republican WIN!
1329087255168708608 2020-11-18 07:41:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In Detroit, there are FAR MORE VOTES THAN PEOPLE. Nothing can be done to cure that giant scam. I win Michigan!
1329086548093014022 2020-11-18 07:38:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The numbers have not improved, it is still 71% out of balance”, stated Wayne County, Michigan,  Canvassers. “There is widespread irregularities in poll numbers.” There are “more votes than people”. The two harassed patriot Canvassers refuse to sign the papers!
1329075487553974275 2020-11-18 06:54:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THEY WOULD’NT LET REPUBLICAN POLL WATCHERS INTO THE COUNTING ROOMS. UNCONSTITUTIONAL!!!
1329069814195871744 2020-11-18 06:31:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Georgia recount is a joke and is being done UNDER PROTEST. Even though thousands of fraudulent votes have been found, the real number is in matching signatures. Governor must open up the unconstitutional Consent Decree and call in the Legislature!
1329065945160175616 2020-11-18 06:16:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They didn’t even allow Republican Observers into the building to watch. A terrible insult to our Constitution!
1329064787142172673 2020-11-18 06:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This was a rigged election. No Republican Poll Watchers allowed, voting machine “glitches” all over the place (meaning they got caught cheating!), voting after election ended, and so much more!
1329060562442067969 2020-11-18 05:55:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wrong! At first they voted against because there were far more VOTES than PEOPLE (Sad!). Then they were threatened, screamed at and viciously harassed, and were FORCED to change their vote, but then REFUSED, as American patriots, to sign the documents. 71% MESS. Don’t Harass!
1329054683441278977 2020-11-18 05:31:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...AND I WON THE ELECTION. VOTER FRAUD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY!

1328900747497525248 2020-11-17 19:20:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Governor Kemp will hopefully see the light before it is too late. Must finally take charge! Two GREAT Senators, who do so much for Georgia and truly love the USA, are in a must win battle with two incompetents who don’t have a clue!
1328886891765182466 2020-11-17 18:24:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Well, it’s really quite simple. You just can’t have more votes than people!
1328886157246156801 2020-11-17 18:22:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> More votes than people, and that is the least of it!!!
1328885313729687553 2020-11-17 18:18:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Flip Michigan back to TRUMP. Detroit, not surprisingly, has tremendous problems!
1328883405837258753 2020-11-17 18:11:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Michigan just refused to certify the election results! Having courage is a beautiful thing. The USA stands proud!

1328856932011167744 2020-11-17 16:25:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The only thing secure about our 2020 Election was that it was virtually impenetrable by foreign powers. On that, the Trump Administration takes great credit. Unfortunately, the Radical Left Democrats, Dominion, and others, were perhaps more successful!

The all Democrat County Commissioner race, on same ballot as President, just thrown out because of large scale voter discrepancy. Clark County officials do not have confidence in their own election security. Major impact!
1328448530504163329 2020-11-16 13:23:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The rate of rejected Mail-In Ballots is 30 X’s lower in Pennsylvania this year than it was in 2016. This is why they kept our poll watchers and observers out of the “SACRED” vote counting rooms!  https://t.co/QPlzfimbd4

1328152466752491526 2020-11-15 17:46:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....owned Dominion Voting Systems, turned down by Texas and many others because it was not good or secure, those responsible for the safeguarding of our Constitution cannot allow the Fake results of the 2020 Mail-In Election to stand. The World is watching!
1328152465016020993 2020-11-15 17:46:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....perhaps like never before! From large numbers of Poll Watchers that were thrown out of vote counting rooms in many of our States, to millions of ballots that have been altered by Democrats, only for Democrats, to voting after the Election was over, to using Radical Left
1328152462331699202 2020-11-15 17:46:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why does the Fake News Media continuously assume that Joe Biden will ascend to the Presidency, not even allowing our side to show, which we are just getting ready to do, how badly shattered and violated our great Constitution has been in the 2020 Election. It was attacked,..
1328137498069970947 2020-11-15 16:47:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A great launch! @NASA was a closed up disaster when we took over. Now it is again the “hottest”, most advanced, space center in the world, by far!
1328100945570500608 2020-11-15 14:21:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Many of the court cases being filed all over the Country are not ours, but rather those of people that have seen horrible abuses. Our big cases showing the unconstitutionality of the 2020 Election, &amp; the outrage of things that were done to change the outcome, will soon be filed!
1328094310294822917 2020-11-15 13:55:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Spirit like never before!
1328094121295286273 2020-11-15 13:54:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Amazing!
1328093294782509060 2020-11-15 13:51:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We won’t let a RIGGED ELECTION steal our Country!

These thugs and lowlifes only stalked and attacked when most of the tens of thousands of people had left town. Ran away earlier!
1328057941203836930 2020-11-15 11:31:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great job Emily!
1328055196904251397 2020-11-15 11:20:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> John Bolton was one of the dumbest people in government that I’ve had the “pleasure” to work with. A sullen, dull and quiet guy, he added nothing to National Security except, “Gee, let’s go to war.” Also, illegally released much Classified Information. A real dope!

1327988661418340353 2020-11-15 06:55:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Progress!
1327979630477922304 2020-11-15 06:19:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!
1327978710809661440 2020-11-15 06:16:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> RIGGED ELECTION. WE WILL WIN!
1327960545929072645 2020-11-15 05:04:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Watch @RudyGiuliani interview on @MariaBartiromo this morning at 10:00. Doing a great job exposing the Rigged Election Hoax!
1327958640309972992 2020-11-15 04:56:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> All of the mechanical “glitches” that took place on Election Night were really THEM getting caught trying to steal votes. They succeeded plenty, however, without getting caught. Mail-in elections are a sick joke!
1327956491056279552 2020-11-15 04:47:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He won because the Election was Rigged. NO VOTE WATCHERS OR OBSERVERS allowed, vote tabulated by a Radical Left privately owned company, Dominion, with a bad reputation &amp; bum equipment that couldn’t even qualify for Texas (which I won by a lot!), the Fake &amp; Silent Media, &amp; more!
1327950785959915520 2020-11-15 04:25:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is why @FoxNews daytime and weekend daytime have lost their ratings. They are abysmal having @alfredenewman1 (Mayor Pete of Indiana’s most unsuccessful city, by far!) on more than Republicans. Many great alternatives are forming &amp; exist. Try @OANN &amp; @newsmax, among others!

1327840088731029504 2020-11-14 21:05:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mark, but the Fake News Media will never say it!
1327838908089069568 2020-11-14 21:00:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News Media hardly even discussed the tens of thousands of people that came to D.C. Formed organically, and in many parts of the Country!
1327837956820914178 2020-11-14 20:56:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mollie. The Free and Fair Press is gone in our country. They only write about what they want to write about. SUPPRESSION!
1327836670742450177 2020-11-14 20:51:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Silent Media is the Enemy of the People!!!
1327834542707793921 2020-11-14 20:43:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Radical Left ANTIFA SCUM was easily rebuffed today by the big D.C. MAGA Rally crowd, only to return at night, after 99% of the crowd had left, to assault elderly people and families. Police got there, but late. Mayor is not doing her job!
1327828007311073280 2020-11-14 20:17:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ANTIFA SCUM ran for the hills today when they tried attacking the people at the Trump Rally, because those people aggressively fought back. Antifa waited until tonight, when 99% were gone, to attack innocent #MAGA People. DC Police, get going — do your job and don’t hold back!!!
1327811527123103746 2020-11-14 19:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I look forward to Mayor Giuliani spearheading the legal effort to defend OUR RIGHT to FREE and FAIR ELECTIONS! Rudy Giuliani, Joseph diGenova, Victoria Toensing, Sidney Powell, and Jenna Ellis, a truly great team, added to our other wonderful lawyers and representatives!
1327750127679889409 2020-11-14 15:07:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There is tremendous evidence of wide spread voter fraud in that there is irrefutable proof that our Republican poll watchers and observers were not allowed to be present in poll counting rooms. Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and others. Unconstitutional!

1327717223142731779 2020-11-14 12:57:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They wouldn’t let our Poll Watchers and Observers into the Counting Rooms. We win on that alone!

1327715767916392449 2020-11-14 12:51:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The hand recount taking place in Georgia is a waste of time. They are not showing the matching signatures. Call off the recount until they allow the MATCH. Don’t let the Radical Left Dems STEAL THE ELECTION!
1327708998662025216 2020-11-14 12:24:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hundreds of thousands of people showing their support in D.C. They will not stand for a Rigged and Corrupt Election!
1327707126375051267 2020-11-14 12:17:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We will WIN!
1327704841964183552 2020-11-14 12:07:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> People are not going to stand for having this Election stolen from them by a privately owned Radical Left company, Dominion, and many other reasons!

1327638502280925184 2020-11-14 07:44:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I LOVE NEW YORK! As everyone knows, the Trump Administration has produced a great and safe VACCINE far ahead of schedule. Another Administration would have taken five years. The problem is, @NYGovCuomo said that he will delay using it, and other states WANT IT NOW...

1327633164823617548 2020-11-14 07:23:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congress must now do a Covid Relief Bill. Needs Democrats support. Make it big and focused. Get it done!
1327619654592892931 2020-11-14 06:29:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....What are they trying to hide. They know, and so does everyone else. EXPOSE THE CRIME!
1327619653020110850 2020-11-14 06:29:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Consent Decree signed by the Georgia Secretary of State, with the approval of Governor @BrianKempGA, at the urging of @staceyabrams, makes it impossible to check &amp; match signatures on ballots and envelopes, etc. They knew they were going to cheat. Must expose real signatures!

1329093126238203905 2020-11-18 08:04:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Great State of Michigan, with votes being far greater than the number of people who voted, cannot certify the election. The Democrats cheated big time, and got caught. A Republican WIN!
1329087255168708608 2020-11-18 07:41:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In Detroit, there are FAR MORE VOTES THAN PEOPLE. Nothing can be done to cure that giant scam. I win Michigan!
1329086548093014022 2020-11-18 07:38:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The numbers have not improved, it is still 71% out of balance”, stated Wayne County, Michigan,  Canvassers. “There is widespread irregularities in poll numbers.” There are “more votes than people”. The two harassed patriot Canvassers refuse to sign the papers!
1329075487553974275 2020-11-18 06:54:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THEY WOULD’NT LET REPUBLICAN POLL WATCHERS INTO THE COUNTING ROOMS. UNCONSTITUTIONAL!!!
1329069814195871744 2020-11-18 06:31:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Georgia recount is a joke and is being done UNDER PROTEST. Even though thousands of fraudulent votes have been found, the real number is in matching signatures. Governor must open up the unconstitutional Consent Decree and call in the Legislature!
1329065945160175616 2020-11-18 06:16:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They didn’t even allow Republican Observers into the building to watch. A terrible insult to our Constitution!
1329064787142172673 2020-11-18 06:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This was a rigged election. No Republican Poll Watchers allowed, voting machine “glitches” all over the place (meaning they got caught cheating!), voting after election ended, and so much more!
1329060562442067969 2020-11-18 05:55:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wrong! At first they voted against because there were far more VOTES than PEOPLE (Sad!). Then they were threatened, screamed at and viciously harassed, and were FORCED to change their vote, but then REFUSED, as American patriots, to sign the documents. 71% MESS. Don’t Harass!
1329054683441278977 2020-11-18 05:31:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...AND I WON THE ELECTION. VOTER FRAUD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY!

1328900747497525248 2020-11-17 19:20:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Governor Kemp will hopefully see the light before it is too late. Must finally take charge! Two GREAT Senators, who do so much for Georgia and truly love the USA, are in a must win battle with two incompetents who don’t have a clue!
1328886891765182466 2020-11-17 18:24:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Well, it’s really quite simple. You just can’t have more votes than people!
1328886157246156801 2020-11-17 18:22:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> More votes than people, and that is the least of it!!!
1328885313729687553 2020-11-17 18:18:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Flip Michigan back to TRUMP. Detroit, not surprisingly, has tremendous problems!
1328883405837258753 2020-11-17 18:11:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Michigan just refused to certify the election results! Having courage is a beautiful thing. The USA stands proud!

1328856932011167744 2020-11-17 16:25:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The only thing secure about our 2020 Election was that it was virtually impenetrable by foreign powers. On that, the Trump Administration takes great credit. Unfortunately, the Radical Left Democrats, Dominion, and others, were perhaps more successful!

1328328019807776768 2020-11-16 05:24:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Andrew!
1328324377168015360 2020-11-16 05:09:45 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Washington Post forgot to read the complaint. Fake News. Poll Watchers, and the way they were treated, are a very big deal in the complaint!
1328200072987893762 2020-11-15 20:55:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I WON THE ELECTION!
1328152466752491526 2020-11-15 17:46:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....owned Dominion Voting Systems, turned down by Texas and many others because it was not good or secure, those responsible for the safeguarding of our Constitution cannot allow the Fake results of the 2020 Mail-In Election to stand. The World is watching!
1328152465016020993 2020-11-15 17:46:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....perhaps like never before! From large numbers of Poll Watchers that were thrown out of vote counting rooms in many of our States, to millions of ballots that have been altered by Democrats, only for Democrats, to voting after the Election was over, to using Radical Left
1328152462331699202 2020-11-15 17:46:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why does the Fake News Media continuously assume that Joe Biden will ascend to the Presidency, not even allowing our side to show, which we are just getting ready to do, how badly shattered and violated our great Constitution has been in the 2020 Election. It was attacked,..
1328137498069970947 2020-11-15 16:47:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A great launch! @NASA was a closed up disaster when we took over. Now it is again the “hottest”, most advanced, space center in the world, by far!
1328100945570500608 2020-11-15 14:21:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Many of the court cases being filed all over the Country are not ours, but rather those of people that have seen horrible abuses. Our big cases showing the unconstitutionality of the 2020 Election, &amp; the outrage of things that were done to change the outcome, will soon be filed!
1328094310294822917 2020-11-15 13:55:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Spirit like never before!
1328094121295286273 2020-11-15 13:54:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Amazing!
1328093294782509060 2020-11-15 13:51:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We won’t let a RIGGED ELECTION steal our Country!

These thugs and lowlifes only stalked and attacked when most of the tens of thousands of people had left town. Ran away earlier!
1328057941203836930 2020-11-15 11:31:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great job Emily!
1328055196904251397 2020-11-15 11:20:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> John Bolton was one of the dumbest people in government that I’ve had the “pleasure” to work with. A sullen, dull and quiet guy, he added nothing to National Security except, “Gee, let’s go to war.” Also, illegally released much Classified Information. A real dope!

1327988661418340353 2020-11-15 06:55:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Progress!
1327979630477922304 2020-11-15 06:19:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!
1327978710809661440 2020-11-15 06:16:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> RIGGED ELECTION. WE WILL WIN!
1327960545929072645 2020-11-15 05:04:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Watch @RudyGiuliani interview on @MariaBartiromo this morning at 10:00. Doing a great job exposing the Rigged Election Hoax!
1327958640309972992 2020-11-15 04:56:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> All of the mechanical “glitches” that took place on Election Night were really THEM getting caught trying to steal votes. They succeeded plenty, however, without getting caught. Mail-in elections are a sick joke!
1327956491056279552 2020-11-15 04:47:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He won because the Election was Rigged. NO VOTE WATCHERS OR OBSERVERS allowed, vote tabulated by a Radical Left privately owned company, Dominion, with a bad reputation &amp; bum equipment that couldn’t even qualify for Texas (which I won by a lot!), the Fake &amp; Silent Media, &amp; more!
1327950785959915520 2020-11-15 04:25:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is why @FoxNews daytime and weekend daytime have lost their ratings. They are abysmal having @alfredenewman1 (Mayor Pete of Indiana’s most unsuccessful city, by far!) on more than Republicans. Many great alternatives are forming &amp; exist. Try @OANN &amp; @newsmax, among others!

1327840088731029504 2020-11-14 21:05:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mark, but the Fake News Media will never say it!
1327838908089069568 2020-11-14 21:00:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News Media hardly even discussed the tens of thousands of people that came to D.C. Formed organically, and in many parts of the Country!
1327837956820914178 2020-11-14 20:56:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mollie. The Free and Fair Press is gone in our country. They only write about what they want to write about. SUPPRESSION!
1327836670742450177 2020-11-14 20:51:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Silent Media is the Enemy of the People!!!
1327834542707793921 2020-11-14 20:43:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Radical Left ANTIFA SCUM was easily rebuffed today by the big D.C. MAGA Rally crowd, only to return at night, after 99% of the crowd had left, to assault elderly people and families. Police got there, but late. Mayor is not doing her job!
1327828007311073280 2020-11-14 20:17:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ANTIFA SCUM ran for the hills today when they tried attacking the people at the Trump Rally, because those people aggressively fought back. Antifa waited until tonight, when 99% were gone, to attack innocent #MAGA People. DC Police, get going — do your job and don’t hold back!!!
1327811527123103746 2020-11-14 19:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I look forward to Mayor Giuliani spearheading the legal effort to defend OUR RIGHT to FREE and FAIR ELECTIONS! Rudy Giuliani, Joseph diGenova, Victoria Toensing, Sidney Powell, and Jenna Ellis, a truly great team, added to our other wonderful lawyers and representatives!
1327750127679889409 2020-11-14 15:07:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There is tremendous evidence of wide spread voter fraud in that there is irrefutable proof that our Republican poll watchers and observers were not allowed to be present in poll counting rooms. Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and others. Unconstitutional!

1327717223142731779 2020-11-14 12:57:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They wouldn’t let our Poll Watchers and Observers into the Counting Rooms. We win on that alone!

1327715767916392449 2020-11-14 12:51:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The hand recount taking place in Georgia is a waste of time. They are not showing the matching signatures. Call off the recount until they allow the MATCH. Don’t let the Radical Left Dems STEAL THE ELECTION!
1327708998662025216 2020-11-14 12:24:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hundreds of thousands of people showing their support in D.C. They will not stand for a Rigged and Corrupt Election!
1327707126375051267 2020-11-14 12:17:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We will WIN!
1327704841964183552 2020-11-14 12:07:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> People are not going to stand for having this Election stolen from them by a privately owned Radical Left company, Dominion, and many other reasons!

1327638502280925184 2020-11-14 07:44:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I LOVE NEW YORK! As everyone knows, the Trump Administration has produced a great and safe VACCINE far ahead of schedule. Another Administration would have taken five years. The problem is, @NYGovCuomo said that he will delay using it, and other states WANT IT NOW...

1327633164823617548 2020-11-14 07:23:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congress must now do a Covid Relief Bill. Needs Democrats support. Make it big and focused. Get it done!
1327619654592892931 2020-11-14 06:29:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....What are they trying to hide. They know, and so does everyone else. EXPOSE THE CRIME!
1327619653020110850 2020-11-14 06:29:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Consent Decree signed by the Georgia Secretary of State, with the approval of Governor @BrianKempGA, at the urging of @staceyabrams, makes it impossible to check &amp; match signatures on ballots and envelopes, etc. They knew they were going to cheat. Must expose real signatures!

1329093126238203905 2020-11-18 08:04:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Great State of Michigan, with votes being far greater than the number of people who voted, cannot certify the election. The Democrats cheated big time, and got caught. A Republican WIN!
1329087255168708608 2020-11-18 07:41:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In Detroit, there are FAR MORE VOTES THAN PEOPLE. Nothing can be done to cure that giant scam. I win Michigan!
1329086548093014022 2020-11-18 07:38:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The numbers have not improved, it is still 71% out of balance”, stated Wayne County, Michigan,  Canvassers. “There is widespread irregularities in poll numbers.” There are “more votes than people”. The two harassed patriot Canvassers refuse to sign the papers!
1329075487553974275 2020-11-18 06:54:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THEY WOULD’NT LET REPUBLICAN POLL WATCHERS INTO THE COUNTING ROOMS. UNCONSTITUTIONAL!!!
1329069814195871744 2020-11-18 06:31:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Georgia recount is a joke and is being done UNDER PROTEST. Even though thousands of fraudulent votes have been found, the real number is in matching signatures. Governor must open up the unconstitutional Consent Decree and call in the Legislature!
1329065945160175616 2020-11-18 06:16:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They didn’t even allow Republican Observers into the building to watch. A terrible insult to our Constitution!
1329064787142172673 2020-11-18 06:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This was a rigged election. No Republican Poll Watchers allowed, voting machine “glitches” all over the place (meaning they got caught cheating!), voting after election ended, and so much more!
1329060562442067969 2020-11-18 05:55:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wrong! At first they voted against because there were far more VOTES than PEOPLE (Sad!). Then they were threatened, screamed at and viciously harassed, and were FORCED to change their vote, but then REFUSED, as American patriots, to sign the documents. 71% MESS. Don’t Harass!
1329054683441278977 2020-11-18 05:31:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...AND I WON THE ELECTION. VOTER FRAUD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY!

1328900747497525248 2020-11-17 19:20:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Governor Kemp will hopefully see the light before it is too late. Must finally take charge! Two GREAT Senators, who do so much for Georgia and truly love the USA, are in a must win battle with two incompetents who don’t have a clue!
1328886891765182466 2020-11-17 18:24:59 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Well, it’s really quite simple. You just can’t have more votes than people!
1328886157246156801 2020-11-17 18:22:04 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> More votes than people, and that is the least of it!!!
1328885313729687553 2020-11-17 18:18:42 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Flip Michigan back to TRUMP. Detroit, not surprisingly, has tremendous problems!
1328883405837258753 2020-11-17 18:11:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wow! Michigan just refused to certify the election results! Having courage is a beautiful thing. The USA stands proud!

1328856932011167744 2020-11-17 16:25:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The only thing secure about our 2020 Election was that it was virtually impenetrable by foreign powers. On that, the Trump Administration takes great credit. Unfortunately, the Radical Left Democrats, Dominion, and others, were perhaps more successful!

1328338241284616193 2020-11-16 06:04:50 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake recount going on in Georgia means nothing because they are not allowing signatures to be looked at and verified. Break the unconstitutional Consent Decree!
1328334945148952576 2020-11-16 05:51:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I won the Election!
1328330303103000577 2020-11-16 05:33:18 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I strongly stand with Kelly &amp; David. They are both great and MUST WIN!
1328328547598000130 2020-11-16 05:26:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Dominion is running our Election. Rigged!
1328328019807776768 2020-11-16 05:24:13 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Andrew!
1328324377168015360 2020-11-16 05:09:45 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Washington Post forgot to read the complaint. Fake News. Poll Watchers, and the way they were treated, are a very big deal in the complaint!
1328200072987893762 2020-11-15 20:55:48 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I WON THE ELECTION!
1328152466752491526 2020-11-15 17:46:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....owned Dominion Voting Systems, turned down by Texas and many others because it was not good or secure, those responsible for the safeguarding of our Constitution cannot allow the Fake results of the 2020 Mail-In Election to stand. The World is watching!
1328152465016020993 2020-11-15 17:46:38 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....perhaps like never before! From large numbers of Poll Watchers that were thrown out of vote counting rooms in many of our States, to millions of ballots that have been altered by Democrats, only for Democrats, to voting after the Election was over, to using Radical Left
1328152462331699202 2020-11-15 17:46:37 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Why does the Fake News Media continuously assume that Joe Biden will ascend to the Presidency, not even allowing our side to show, which we are just getting ready to do, how badly shattered and violated our great Constitution has been in the 2020 Election. It was attacked,..
1328137498069970947 2020-11-15 16:47:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> A great launch! @NASA was a closed up disaster when we took over. Now it is again the “hottest”, most advanced, space center in the world, by far!
1328100945570500608 2020-11-15 14:21:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Many of the court cases being filed all over the Country are not ours, but rather those of people that have seen horrible abuses. Our big cases showing the unconstitutionality of the 2020 Election, &amp; the outrage of things that were done to change the outcome, will soon be filed!
1328094310294822917 2020-11-15 13:55:33 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Spirit like never before!
1328094121295286273 2020-11-15 13:54:47 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Amazing!
1328093294782509060 2020-11-15 13:51:30 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We won’t let a RIGGED ELECTION steal our Country!
1328089401008807943 2020-11-15 13:36:02 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> WATCH: D.C. Cops Direct Trump-Supporters into Gauntlet of Protesters, Do Nothing When They Are Assaulted  https://t.co/179yDCbZou via @BreitbartNews. These thugs and lowlifes only stalked and attacked when most of the tens of thousands of people had left town. Ran away earlier!
1328057941203836930 2020-11-15 11:31:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Great job Emily!
1328055196904251397 2020-11-15 11:20:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> John Bolton was one of the dumbest people in government that I’ve had the “pleasure” to work with. A sullen, dull and quiet guy, he added nothing to National Security except, “Gee, let’s go to war.” Also, illegally released much Classified Information. A real dope!

1327989713786036227 2020-11-15 06:59:55 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Rudy will be interviewed by @MariaBartiromo at 10:00 A.M. NOW!
1327988661418340353 2020-11-15 06:55:44 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Progress!
1327979630477922304 2020-11-15 06:19:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!
1327978710809661440 2020-11-15 06:16:11 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> RIGGED ELECTION. WE WILL WIN!
1327960545929072645 2020-11-15 05:04:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Watch @RudyGiuliani interview on @MariaBartiromo this morning at 10:00. Doing a great job exposing the Rigged Election Hoax!
1327958640309972992 2020-11-15 04:56:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> All of the mechanical “glitches” that took place on Election Night were really THEM getting caught trying to steal votes. They succeeded plenty, however, without getting caught. Mail-in elections are a sick joke!
1327956491056279552 2020-11-15 04:47:54 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> He won because the Election was Rigged. NO VOTE WATCHERS OR OBSERVERS allowed, vote tabulated by a Radical Left privately owned company, Dominion, with a bad reputation &amp; bum equipment that couldn’t even qualify for Texas (which I won by a lot!), the Fake &amp; Silent Media, &amp; more!
1327950785959915520 2020-11-15 04:25:14 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This is why @FoxNews daytime and weekend daytime have lost their ratings. They are abysmal having @alfredenewman1 (Mayor Pete of Indiana’s most unsuccessful city, by far!) on more than Republicans. Many great alternatives are forming &amp; exist. Try @OANN &amp; @newsmax, among others!

1327840088731029504 2020-11-14 21:05:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mark, but the Fake News Media will never say it!
1327838908089069568 2020-11-14 21:00:40 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Fake News Media hardly even discussed the tens of thousands of people that came to D.C. Formed organically, and in many parts of the Country!
1327837956820914178 2020-11-14 20:56:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Thank you Mollie. The Free and Fair Press is gone in our country. They only write about what they want to write about. SUPPRESSION!
1327836670742450177 2020-11-14 20:51:46 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Silent Media is the Enemy of the People!!!
1327834542707793921 2020-11-14 20:43:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Radical Left ANTIFA SCUM was easily rebuffed today by the big D.C. MAGA Rally crowd, only to return at night, after 99% of the crowd had left, to assault elderly people and families. Police got there, but late. Mayor is not doing her job!
1327828007311073280 2020-11-14 20:17:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ANTIFA SCUM ran for the hills today when they tried attacking the people at the Trump Rally, because those people aggressively fought back. Antifa waited until tonight, when 99% were gone, to attack innocent #MAGA People. DC Police, get going — do your job and don’t hold back!!!
1327811527123103746 2020-11-14 19:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I look forward to Mayor Giuliani spearheading the legal effort to defend OUR RIGHT to FREE and FAIR ELECTIONS! Rudy Giuliani, Joseph diGenova, Victoria Toensing, Sidney Powell, and Jenna Ellis, a truly great team, added to our other wonderful lawyers and representatives!
1327750127679889409 2020-11-14 15:07:53 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> There is tremendous evidence of wide spread voter fraud in that there is irrefutable proof that our Republican poll watchers and observers were not allowed to be present in poll counting rooms. Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and others. Unconstitutional!

1327717223142731779 2020-11-14 12:57:08 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They wouldn’t let our Poll Watchers and Observers into the Counting Rooms. We win on that alone!

1327715767916392449 2020-11-14 12:51:21 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The hand recount taking place in Georgia is a waste of time. They are not showing the matching signatures. Call off the recount until they allow the MATCH. Don’t let the Radical Left Dems STEAL THE ELECTION!
1327708998662025216 2020-11-14 12:24:27 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Hundreds of thousands of people showing their support in D.C. They will not stand for a Rigged and Corrupt Election!
1327707126375051267 2020-11-14 12:17:01 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> We will WIN!
1327704841964183552 2020-11-14 12:07:56 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> People are not going to stand for having this Election stolen from them by a privately owned Radical Left company, Dominion, and many other reasons!

1327638503883235332 2020-11-14 07:44:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....We cannot waste time and can only give to those states that will use the Vaccine immediately. Therefore the New York delay. Many lives to be saved, but we are ready when they are. Stop playing politics!
1327638502280925184 2020-11-14 07:44:19 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> I LOVE NEW YORK! As everyone knows, the Trump Administration has produced a great and safe VACCINE far ahead of schedule. Another Administration would have taken five years. The problem is, @NYGovCuomo said that he will delay using it, and other states WANT IT NOW...

1327633164823617548 2020-11-14 07:23:07 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Congress must now do a Covid Relief Bill. Needs Democrats support. Make it big and focused. Get it done!
1327619654592892931 2020-11-14 06:29:26 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ....What are they trying to hide. They know, and so does everyone else. EXPOSE THE CRIME!
1327619653020110850 2020-11-14 06:29:25 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Consent Decree signed by the Georgia Secretary of State, with the approval of Governor @BrianKempGA, at the urging of @staceyabrams, makes it impossible to check &amp; match signatures on ballots and envelopes, etc. They knew they were going to cheat. Must expose real signatures!

1329093126238203905 2020-11-18 08:04:29 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Great State of Michigan, with votes being far greater than the number of people who voted, cannot certify the election. The Democrats cheated big time, and got caught. A Republican WIN!
1329087255168708608 2020-11-18 07:41:09 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> In Detroit, there are FAR MORE VOTES THAN PEOPLE. Nothing can be done to cure that giant scam. I win Michigan!
1329086548093014022 2020-11-18 07:38:20 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> “The numbers have not improved, it is still 71% out of balance”, stated Wayne County, Michigan,  Canvassers. “There is widespread irregularities in poll numbers.” There are “more votes than people”. The two harassed patriot Canvassers refuse to sign the papers!
1329075487553974275 2020-11-18 06:54:23 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> THEY WOULD’NT LET REPUBLICAN POLL WATCHERS INTO THE COUNTING ROOMS. UNCONSTITUTIONAL!!!
1329069814195871744 2020-11-18 06:31:51 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> The Georgia recount is a joke and is being done UNDER PROTEST. Even though thousands of fraudulent votes have been found, the real number is in matching signatures. Governor must open up the unconstitutional Consent Decree and call in the Legislature!
1329065945160175616 2020-11-18 06:16:28 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> They didn’t even allow Republican Observers into the building to watch. A terrible insult to our Constitution!
1329064787142172673 2020-11-18 06:11:52 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> This was a rigged election. No Republican Poll Watchers allowed, voting machine “glitches” all over the place (meaning they got caught cheating!), voting after election ended, and so much more!
1329060562442067969 2020-11-18 05:55:05 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> Wrong! At first they voted against because there were far more VOTES than PEOPLE (Sad!). Then they were threatened, screamed at and viciously harassed, and were FORCED to change their vote, but then REFUSED, as American patriots, to sign the documents. 71% MESS. Don’t Harass!
1329054683441278977 2020-11-18 05:31:43 -0800 <realDonaldTrump> ...AND I WON THE ELECTION. VOTER FRAUD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY!

1332604028979699715 2020-11-28 00:35:33 -0800 <rockerskating> I’ll say it again: the introduction of the q in the IJS is a step backward.

1332604028979699715 2020-11-28 00:35:33 -0800 <rockerskating> I’ll say it again: the introduction of the q in the IJS is a step backward.

1332222891858014209 2020-11-26 23:21:03 -0800 <rockerskating> Yeah, Marin Honda should be like 35 in PCS but they're not gonna give her that  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332222752145756160 2020-11-26 23:20:30 -0800 <rockerskating> Marin Honda JPN 3Lo2T, 3F(q?), 2A - gosh, looking so much stronger than even a couple weeks ago at Sectionals, good to see her on the way back up from her shoulder dislocation a couple months ago; this program is a beauty  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332222079022804994 2020-11-26 23:17:49 -0800 <rockerskating> I still have no idea why Tomoe Kawabata was under 30 in PCS  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332221213104599045 2020-11-26 23:14:23 -0800 <rockerskating> Mako Yamashita JPN 3Lo, 2A, 3Lz3T - strong skate for Yamashita, she's definitely grown into this program but I've just never figured out how to get into this version of this aria  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332215668486320129 2020-11-26 22:52:21 -0800 <rockerskating> Tomoe Kawabata JPN 3Lz3T, 3Lo(turn), 2A(step) - even with that turnout on the loop, I'd very much have this program in front, Kawabata's skating is heads above the rest so far ... and then the axel stepout (sigh)  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332215261827633153 2020-11-26 22:50:44 -0800 <rockerskating> Wow, the reset on the slightly overrotated lutz to launch the 3T was so good from Kawabata - that combo could've really gone off the rails  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332209954686701568 2020-11-26 22:29:39 -0800 <rockerskating> Ok, the fact that an international unknown like Rino Matsuike got ~30 on PCS gives me hope that they might not lowball their top skaters on PCS after all  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1331760335330668545 2020-11-25 16:43:01 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 @JohnWilsonBlade @edeaskates The reason I say go with rentals first is because breaking in boots is a whole different thing in itself. It requires you to be pretty steady on skates because it’s real tough to learn how to skate in new boots
1331760100965572610 2020-11-25 16:42:05 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 Then talk to your coach / pro shop about it. I’ve always been with @JohnWilsonBlade from beginner standard blades to advanced double/triple jump blades. I got into @edeaskates boots very recently and I really like them, but they are different than normal
1331759634907099138 2020-11-25 16:40:14 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 Gotta say, I’m not the most knowledgeable about where to start (I don’t even remember how I got started with skates - I think my group lessons coach just said, go get these!). If I were you, I would start with rental skates first and get used to skating / take some lessons
1331731738742108163 2020-11-25 14:49:23 -0800 <rockerskating> Still life of skate and blade  https://t.co/3CrVksvzop
1331588472239480833 2020-11-25 05:20:06 -0800 <rockerskating> First thought this morning: Daisuke Takahashi is making his ice dance debut this week  https://t.co/DdMSAcDOK5
1331447042762280960 2020-11-24 19:58:06 -0800 <rockerskating> @Jacqueline4Fun Haha this was a very standard toe loop entry for a really long time ... hasn’t been the case for prob the past 15-20 years
1331438425015267328 2020-11-24 19:23:52 -0800 <rockerskating> @aprimo224 He did. But this post is about Urmanov’s 4T and I didn’t say anything about this being the first quad toe.
1331437373088002048 2020-11-24 19:19:41 -0800 <rockerskating> For some reason, my walk down memory lane went On Golden Pond - this program keeps moving upward in my list of great programs of all time:  https://t.co/bAWLFbkUQd
1331430276682039299 2020-11-24 18:51:29 -0800 <rockerskating> This quad toe is almost 30 years old. Alexei Urmanov - 1991 Worlds  https://t.co/6KcGgow8Zm

1330968023835013121 2020-11-23 12:14:39 -0800 <rockerskating> @SASgrafix @grasshopperay You can do triple-triple-triple, but it doesn’t make sense from a calculation standpoint. I wrote a whole tome on it at the Olympics:  https://t.co/uI4yKxpIUA
1330739202913398786 2020-11-22 21:05:24 -0800 <rockerskating> @BrownJefe I just rewatched both Euros and Worlds versions. The flip in both programs almost identical :(
1330739043265617921 2020-11-22 21:04:46 -0800 <rockerskating> @grasshopperay @SASgrafix I mean, technically it’s not “disallowed” - it’s more than only the first 3 jumps will count toward the combo
1330720087175819264 2020-11-22 19:49:27 -0800 <rockerskating> @BrownJefe I’m still sad she fell on that 3F in 1994 in her FS and it kept her off the Worlds podium
1330714299745120262 2020-11-22 19:26:27 -0800 <rockerskating> @VM2022Beijing Marina Kielmann. This was in 1993, so I think Slutskaya was 12 or 13 at this point
1330671501234892800 2020-11-22 16:36:23 -0800 <rockerskating> @SASgrafix Even better 2A1Lo1Lo2Lo1Lo2Lo combo

1330342778652520450 2020-11-21 18:50:09 -0800 <rockerskating> Still.
1330322752444706820 2020-11-21 17:30:35 -0800 <rockerskating> Yes they can, especially for someone whose needs to concentrate on their skating skills to make them good. Taking the time to focus on edge quality and power stroking is an art in itself. It’s not a given.
1330296885173768197 2020-11-21 15:47:47 -0800 <rockerskating> @katrenmet It indicates that it's a sequence (not a combo), which means the base value is calculated differently - combo is 100% of the jumps added together, sequence is 80% of the jumps added together
1330295011188105216 2020-11-21 15:40:21 -0800 <rockerskating> @JohnWilsonBlade It's them blades, isn't it?

1332604028979699715 2020-11-28 00:35:33 -0800 <rockerskating> I’ll say it again: the introduction of the q in the IJS is a step backward.

1332222891858014209 2020-11-26 23:21:03 -0800 <rockerskating> Yeah, Marin Honda should be like 35 in PCS but they're not gonna give her that  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332222752145756160 2020-11-26 23:20:30 -0800 <rockerskating> Marin Honda JPN 3Lo2T, 3F(q?), 2A - gosh, looking so much stronger than even a couple weeks ago at Sectionals, good to see her on the way back up from her shoulder dislocation a couple months ago; this program is a beauty  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332222079022804994 2020-11-26 23:17:49 -0800 <rockerskating> I still have no idea why Tomoe Kawabata was under 30 in PCS  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332221213104599045 2020-11-26 23:14:23 -0800 <rockerskating> Mako Yamashita JPN 3Lo, 2A, 3Lz3T - strong skate for Yamashita, she's definitely grown into this program but I've just never figured out how to get into this version of this aria  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332216613421146112 2020-11-26 22:56:06 -0800 <rockerskating> Tomoe Kawabata JPN 3Lz3T(q?), 3Lo(turn), 2A(step) TES 30.75, PCS 29.08, SP 59.83 into 3rd - I don't agree with those PCS at all, should've been over 30 for sure  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332215668486320129 2020-11-26 22:52:21 -0800 <rockerskating> Tomoe Kawabata JPN 3Lz3T, 3Lo(turn), 2A(step) - even with that turnout on the loop, I'd very much have this program in front, Kawabata's skating is heads above the rest so far ... and then the axel stepout (sigh)  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332215261827633153 2020-11-26 22:50:44 -0800 <rockerskating> Wow, the reset on the slightly overrotated lutz to launch the 3T was so good from Kawabata - that combo could've really gone off the rails  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332209954686701568 2020-11-26 22:29:39 -0800 <rockerskating> Ok, the fact that an international unknown like Rino Matsuike got ~30 on PCS gives me hope that they might not lowball their top skaters on PCS after all  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1331760335330668545 2020-11-25 16:43:01 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 @JohnWilsonBlade @edeaskates The reason I say go with rentals first is because breaking in boots is a whole different thing in itself. It requires you to be pretty steady on skates because it’s real tough to learn how to skate in new boots
1331760100965572610 2020-11-25 16:42:05 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 Then talk to your coach / pro shop about it. I’ve always been with @JohnWilsonBlade from beginner standard blades to advanced double/triple jump blades. I got into @edeaskates boots very recently and I really like them, but they are different than normal
1331759634907099138 2020-11-25 16:40:14 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 Gotta say, I’m not the most knowledgeable about where to start (I don’t even remember how I got started with skates - I think my group lessons coach just said, go get these!). If I were you, I would start with rental skates first and get used to skating / take some lessons
1331731738742108163 2020-11-25 14:49:23 -0800 <rockerskating> Still life of skate and blade  https://t.co/3CrVksvzop
1331588472239480833 2020-11-25 05:20:06 -0800 <rockerskating> First thought this morning: Daisuke Takahashi is making his ice dance debut this week  https://t.co/DdMSAcDOK5
1331447042762280960 2020-11-24 19:58:06 -0800 <rockerskating> @Jacqueline4Fun Haha this was a very standard toe loop entry for a really long time ... hasn’t been the case for prob the past 15-20 years
1331438425015267328 2020-11-24 19:23:52 -0800 <rockerskating> @aprimo224 He did. But this post is about Urmanov’s 4T and I didn’t say anything about this being the first quad toe.
1331437373088002048 2020-11-24 19:19:41 -0800 <rockerskating> For some reason, my walk down memory lane went On Golden Pond - this program keeps moving upward in my list of great programs of all time:  https://t.co/bAWLFbkUQd
1331430276682039299 2020-11-24 18:51:29 -0800 <rockerskating> This quad toe is almost 30 years old. Alexei Urmanov - 1991 Worlds  https://t.co/6KcGgow8Zm

1330968023835013121 2020-11-23 12:14:39 -0800 <rockerskating> @SASgrafix @grasshopperay You can do triple-triple-triple, but it doesn’t make sense from a calculation standpoint. I wrote a whole tome on it at the Olympics:  https://t.co/uI4yKxpIUA
1330739202913398786 2020-11-22 21:05:24 -0800 <rockerskating> @BrownJefe I just rewatched both Euros and Worlds versions. The flip in both programs almost identical :(
1330739043265617921 2020-11-22 21:04:46 -0800 <rockerskating> @grasshopperay @SASgrafix I mean, technically it’s not “disallowed” - it’s more than only the first 3 jumps will count toward the combo
1330720087175819264 2020-11-22 19:49:27 -0800 <rockerskating> @BrownJefe I’m still sad she fell on that 3F in 1994 in her FS and it kept her off the Worlds podium
1330714299745120262 2020-11-22 19:26:27 -0800 <rockerskating> @VM2022Beijing Marina Kielmann. This was in 1993, so I think Slutskaya was 12 or 13 at this point
1330671501234892800 2020-11-22 16:36:23 -0800 <rockerskating> @SASgrafix Even better 2A1Lo1Lo2Lo1Lo2Lo combo

1330342778652520450 2020-11-21 18:50:09 -0800 <rockerskating> Still.
1330322752444706820 2020-11-21 17:30:35 -0800 <rockerskating> Yes they can, especially for someone whose needs to concentrate on their skating skills to make them good. Taking the time to focus on edge quality and power stroking is an art in itself. It’s not a given.
1330296885173768197 2020-11-21 15:47:47 -0800 <rockerskating> @katrenmet It indicates that it's a sequence (not a combo), which means the base value is calculated differently - combo is 100% of the jumps added together, sequence is 80% of the jumps added together
1330295011188105216 2020-11-21 15:40:21 -0800 <rockerskating> @JohnWilsonBlade It's them blades, isn't it?

1332604028979699715 2020-11-28 00:35:33 -0800 <rockerskating> I’ll say it again: the introduction of the q in the IJS is a step backward.

1332222891858014209 2020-11-26 23:21:03 -0800 <rockerskating> Yeah, Marin Honda should be like 35 in PCS but they're not gonna give her that  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332222752145756160 2020-11-26 23:20:30 -0800 <rockerskating> Marin Honda JPN 3Lo2T, 3F(q?), 2A - gosh, looking so much stronger than even a couple weeks ago at Sectionals, good to see her on the way back up from her shoulder dislocation a couple months ago; this program is a beauty  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332222079022804994 2020-11-26 23:17:49 -0800 <rockerskating> I still have no idea why Tomoe Kawabata was under 30 in PCS  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332221213104599045 2020-11-26 23:14:23 -0800 <rockerskating> Mako Yamashita JPN 3Lo, 2A, 3Lz3T - strong skate for Yamashita, she's definitely grown into this program but I've just never figured out how to get into this version of this aria  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332216613421146112 2020-11-26 22:56:06 -0800 <rockerskating> Tomoe Kawabata JPN 3Lz3T(q?), 3Lo(turn), 2A(step) TES 30.75, PCS 29.08, SP 59.83 into 3rd - I don't agree with those PCS at all, should've been over 30 for sure  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332215668486320129 2020-11-26 22:52:21 -0800 <rockerskating> Tomoe Kawabata JPN 3Lz3T, 3Lo(turn), 2A(step) - even with that turnout on the loop, I'd very much have this program in front, Kawabata's skating is heads above the rest so far ... and then the axel stepout (sigh)  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332215261827633153 2020-11-26 22:50:44 -0800 <rockerskating> Wow, the reset on the slightly overrotated lutz to launch the 3T was so good from Kawabata - that combo could've really gone off the rails  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332209954686701568 2020-11-26 22:29:39 -0800 <rockerskating> Ok, the fact that an international unknown like Rino Matsuike got ~30 on PCS gives me hope that they might not lowball their top skaters on PCS after all  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1331760335330668545 2020-11-25 16:43:01 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 @JohnWilsonBlade @edeaskates The reason I say go with rentals first is because breaking in boots is a whole different thing in itself. It requires you to be pretty steady on skates because it’s real tough to learn how to skate in new boots
1331760100965572610 2020-11-25 16:42:05 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 Then talk to your coach / pro shop about it. I’ve always been with @JohnWilsonBlade from beginner standard blades to advanced double/triple jump blades. I got into @edeaskates boots very recently and I really like them, but they are different than normal
1331759634907099138 2020-11-25 16:40:14 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 Gotta say, I’m not the most knowledgeable about where to start (I don’t even remember how I got started with skates - I think my group lessons coach just said, go get these!). If I were you, I would start with rental skates first and get used to skating / take some lessons
1331731738742108163 2020-11-25 14:49:23 -0800 <rockerskating> Still life of skate and blade  https://t.co/3CrVksvzop
1331588472239480833 2020-11-25 05:20:06 -0800 <rockerskating> First thought this morning: Daisuke Takahashi is making his ice dance debut this week  https://t.co/DdMSAcDOK5
1331447042762280960 2020-11-24 19:58:06 -0800 <rockerskating> @Jacqueline4Fun Haha this was a very standard toe loop entry for a really long time ... hasn’t been the case for prob the past 15-20 years
1331438425015267328 2020-11-24 19:23:52 -0800 <rockerskating> @aprimo224 He did. But this post is about Urmanov’s 4T and I didn’t say anything about this being the first quad toe.
1331437373088002048 2020-11-24 19:19:41 -0800 <rockerskating> For some reason, my walk down memory lane went On Golden Pond - this program keeps moving upward in my list of great programs of all time:  https://t.co/bAWLFbkUQd
1331430276682039299 2020-11-24 18:51:29 -0800 <rockerskating> This quad toe is almost 30 years old. Alexei Urmanov - 1991 Worlds  https://t.co/6KcGgow8Zm

1330968023835013121 2020-11-23 12:14:39 -0800 <rockerskating> @SASgrafix @grasshopperay You can do triple-triple-triple, but it doesn’t make sense from a calculation standpoint. I wrote a whole tome on it at the Olympics:  https://t.co/uI4yKxpIUA
1330739202913398786 2020-11-22 21:05:24 -0800 <rockerskating> @BrownJefe I just rewatched both Euros and Worlds versions. The flip in both programs almost identical :(
1330739043265617921 2020-11-22 21:04:46 -0800 <rockerskating> @grasshopperay @SASgrafix I mean, technically it’s not “disallowed” - it’s more than only the first 3 jumps will count toward the combo
1330720087175819264 2020-11-22 19:49:27 -0800 <rockerskating> @BrownJefe I’m still sad she fell on that 3F in 1994 in her FS and it kept her off the Worlds podium
1330714299745120262 2020-11-22 19:26:27 -0800 <rockerskating> @VM2022Beijing Marina Kielmann. This was in 1993, so I think Slutskaya was 12 or 13 at this point
1330671501234892800 2020-11-22 16:36:23 -0800 <rockerskating> @SASgrafix Even better 2A1Lo1Lo2Lo1Lo2Lo combo

1330342778652520450 2020-11-21 18:50:09 -0800 <rockerskating> Still.
1330322752444706820 2020-11-21 17:30:35 -0800 <rockerskating> Yes they can, especially for someone whose needs to concentrate on their skating skills to make them good. Taking the time to focus on edge quality and power stroking is an art in itself. It’s not a given.
1330296885173768197 2020-11-21 15:47:47 -0800 <rockerskating> @katrenmet It indicates that it's a sequence (not a combo), which means the base value is calculated differently - combo is 100% of the jumps added together, sequence is 80% of the jumps added together
1330295011188105216 2020-11-21 15:40:21 -0800 <rockerskating> @JohnWilsonBlade It's them blades, isn't it?

1332604028979699715 2020-11-28 00:35:33 -0800 <rockerskating> I’ll say it again: the introduction of the q in the IJS is a step backward.

When you can exactly measure direction of takeoff w respect to blade positioning at landing, then let’s talk

1331760335330668545 2020-11-25 16:43:01 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 @JohnWilsonBlade @edeaskates The reason I say go with rentals first is because breaking in boots is a whole different thing in itself. It requires you to be pretty steady on skates because it’s real tough to learn how to skate in new boots
1331760100965572610 2020-11-25 16:42:05 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 Then talk to your coach / pro shop about it. I’ve always been with @JohnWilsonBlade from beginner standard blades to advanced double/triple jump blades. I got into @edeaskates boots very recently and I really like them, but they are different than normal
1331759634907099138 2020-11-25 16:40:14 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 Gotta say, I’m not the most knowledgeable about where to start (I don’t even remember how I got started with skates - I think my group lessons coach just said, go get these!). If I were you, I would start with rental skates first and get used to skating / take some lessons
1331731738742108163 2020-11-25 14:49:23 -0800 <rockerskating> Still life of skate and blade  https://t.co/3CrVksvzop

1331447042762280960 2020-11-24 19:58:06 -0800 <rockerskating> @Jacqueline4Fun Haha this was a very standard toe loop entry for a really long time ... hasn’t been the case for prob the past 15-20 years
1331438425015267328 2020-11-24 19:23:52 -0800 <rockerskating> @aprimo224 He did. But this post is about Urmanov’s 4T and I didn’t say anything about this being the first quad toe.
1331437373088002048 2020-11-24 19:19:41 -0800 <rockerskating> For some reason, my walk down memory lane went On Golden Pond - this program keeps moving upward in my list of great programs of all time:  https://t.co/bAWLFbkUQd

1330968023835013121 2020-11-23 12:14:39 -0800 <rockerskating> @SASgrafix @grasshopperay You can do triple-triple-triple, but it doesn’t make sense from a calculation standpoint. I wrote a whole tome on it at the Olympics:  https://t.co/uI4yKxpIUA
1330739202913398786 2020-11-22 21:05:24 -0800 <rockerskating> @BrownJefe I just rewatched both Euros and Worlds versions. The flip in both programs almost identical :(
1330739043265617921 2020-11-22 21:04:46 -0800 <rockerskating> @grasshopperay @SASgrafix I mean, technically it’s not “disallowed” - it’s more than only the first 3 jumps will count toward the combo
1330720087175819264 2020-11-22 19:49:27 -0800 <rockerskating> @BrownJefe I’m still sad she fell on that 3F in 1994 in her FS and it kept her off the Worlds podium
1330714299745120262 2020-11-22 19:26:27 -0800 <rockerskating> @VM2022Beijing Marina Kielmann. This was in 1993, so I think Slutskaya was 12 or 13 at this point
1330671501234892800 2020-11-22 16:36:23 -0800 <rockerskating> @SASgrafix Even better 2A1Lo1Lo2Lo1Lo2Lo combo

1330342778652520450 2020-11-21 18:50:09 -0800 <rockerskating> Still.
1330322752444706820 2020-11-21 17:30:35 -0800 <rockerskating> Yes they can, especially for someone whose needs to concentrate on their skating skills to make them good. Taking the time to focus on edge quality and power stroking is an art in itself. It’s not a given.
1330296885173768197 2020-11-21 15:47:47 -0800 <rockerskating> @katrenmet It indicates that it's a sequence (not a combo), which means the base value is calculated differently - combo is 100% of the jumps added together, sequence is 80% of the jumps added together
1330295011188105216 2020-11-21 15:40:21 -0800 <rockerskating> @JohnWilsonBlade It's them blades, isn't it?

1328692044727017473 2020-11-17 05:30:44 -0800 <rockerskating> @kcavery “Favorite” can be interpreted in many ways
1328681076861054977 2020-11-17 04:47:09 -0800 <rockerskating> This may be my favorite thread of responses ever. Love all the costumes. Look at all the replies and quote retweets to see for yourself!

1328114784294871041 2020-11-15 15:16:54 -0800 <rockerskating> @angel_ponders Nothing sinister. Big changes like that only happen after the Olympics are over. It’s too much of a strategy change for everyone because the goal is always to optimize for the Olympics if you expect to get there
1328113760880517121 2020-11-15 15:12:50 -0800 <rockerskating> @angel_ponders I expect to see that happen after 2022
1328112094731001857 2020-11-15 15:06:13 -0800 <rockerskating> But the TES/PCS differential has been broken for years, if your goal is for TES &amp; PCS to be more or less equal if you have a clean program w the highest difficulty &amp; highest skating quality  Plus, women are doing 3As / quads, so their TES is now even more overweighted if so (2/2)
1328111192288747522 2020-11-15 15:02:38 -0800 <rockerskating> The short of it is, by making the men's PCS multiplier higher, it's more equal to the potential men's TES because of the historically higher technical content; otherwise, men's TES would be even more overweighted than it is now (1/2)
1328110429332180995 2020-11-15 14:59:36 -0800 <rockerskating> Las Vegas Invitational Team FINAL  Team @taralipinski 828.95 - Andrews 120.70, Shin 132.65, Tennell 140.14, Krasnozhon 138.58, Malinin 114.68, NChen 182.20  Team @JohnnyGWeir 774.98 - KChen 122.43, Liu 110.80, Bell 139.42, Pulkinen 129.46, Hiwatashi 131.40, Zhou 141.47
1328109781383602177 2020-11-15 14:57:01 -0800 <rockerskating> Las Vegas Invitational Men FINAL 2nd number = what it would've been w normal men's PCS multiplier 1 Nathan Chen 182.20 (~200) 2 Vincent Zhou 141.47 (~160) 3 Alex Krasnozhon 138.58 (~154) 4 Tomoki Hiwatashi 131.40 (~148) 5 Camden Pulkinen 129.46 (~145) 6 Ilia Malinin 114.68 (~128)
1328109184638980102 2020-11-15 14:54:39 -0800 <rockerskating> Nathan Chen / Team Tara 4Lo, 3F2T, 3Lz(step), 4S, 4T1Eu3F, 4T3T, 3A(ftdwn) - that was redemption (?) from Skate America, who would've thought we would see Chen land 4Lo 4S and 3A in the same program? TES 108.47, PCS 73.73, FS 182.20 - would've been 200 w normal men's PCS
1328108308465655809 2020-11-15 14:51:10 -0800 <rockerskating> NATHAN CHEN YOU STEPPED OUT OF A TRIPLE LUTZ  https://t.co/g0ZgRSycxy
1328108050432004101 2020-11-15 14:50:08 -0800 <rockerskating> OH NATHAN CHEN QUAD LOOP WE HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN YEARS!!!
1328107823264370688 2020-11-15 14:49:14 -0800 <rockerskating> Vincent Zhou / Team Johnny 4Lz(ur,fall), 1Lz(ftdwn), 3F, 3A3T(q?), 4Lz(ur), 3A2T, 3Lz1Eu3S(step) - hail Mary 4Lz in the second half, gutsy TES 74.20, PCS 68.27, FS 141.47 - would've been right around 160 with normal men's PCS multiplier
1328106924043341825 2020-11-15 14:45:40 -0800 <rockerskating> Ilia Malinin / Team Tara 4T, 3S, 3A(q?step), 3Lz, 2A(step), 3F1Lo, 3Lz2T - a lot of tiredness there; looking forward to seeing what kind of splash he makes at Natls (just learned a 4Lz btwn this comp &amp; today) TES 61.22, PCS 53.46, FS 114.68 - would've been 128 w normal men's PCS
1328106076831625220 2020-11-15 14:42:18 -0800 <rockerskating> Tomoki Hiwatashi / Team Johnny 4T3T, 2T, 3A(ftdwn), 2S(step), 1A, 3Lo, 3Lz1Eu3F - all kinds of base value left on the table with those pops TES 65.80, PCS 65.60, FS 131.40 - would've been about 148 if calibrated to the normal men's PCS multiplier
1328105697326882816 2020-11-15 14:40:47 -0800 <rockerskating> I know this competition was taped just 2 days after Skate America and there was also an exhibition in between, but everyone is just breathing a whole lot harder here - goes to show how much strain a full-week competition is
1328105231087964161 2020-11-15 14:38:56 -0800 <rockerskating> The men's PCS multiplier and the women's PCS multiplier were brought to the same level so that the men's PCS wouldn't be overweighted relative to the women - the men's is usually a 2.0x in the FS, whereas the women's is 1.6x
1328104848571703299 2020-11-15 14:37:25 -0800 <rockerskating> Alex Krasnozhon / Team Tara 4Lo, 3A2T, 3A, 3S, 3F3Lo, 3Lz2T(ur), 3Lz - perhaps the best free skate we've ever seen from Krasnozhon, at least in the jumping department! TES 77.39, PCS 61.19, FS 138.58 - that would've been about 154 if PCS were calibrated to the men's multiplier
1328103979918774272 2020-11-15 14:33:58 -0800 <rockerskating> Wow another quad loop from Alex Krasnozhon! It was a good weekend for that jump for him in Vegas
1328103758438551553 2020-11-15 14:33:05 -0800 <rockerskating> Must be a bit strange for the guys to see their PCS so low, basically 20% lower than it would otherwise be because it's calibrated in line with the women's PCS here
1328103552594677766 2020-11-15 14:32:16 -0800 <rockerskating> Camden Pulkinen / Team Johnny 3Lz(hand,turn), 3A, 3Lo, 3Lz1Eu3S, 3A(ur,fall), 3F, 3T2T - some very strong moments in there but felt a bit pushed through, especially if you look at the spins there; a couple more months of conditioning will help TES 67.13, PCS 63.33, -1, FS 129.46
1328102643491872770 2020-11-15 14:28:39 -0800 <rockerskating> Las Vegas International Ladies FINAL 1 Bradie Tennell 140.14 2 Mariah Bell 139.42 3 Audrey Shin 132.65 4 Karen Chen 122.43 5 Starr Andrews 120.70 6 Alysa Liu 110.80 -- Team Tara 393.49 Team Johnny 372.65
1328101844208513024 2020-11-15 14:25:29 -0800 <rockerskating> Mariah Bell / Team Johnny 2A3T(2ft), 3Lo, 3S(ur?hand?), 3F(ftdwn), 3Lz2T2Lo, 3F2T(hangs on), 3Lz - 1st half of the program looked labored but got stronger toward the end, she has a lot better in her though TES 68.88, PCS 70.54, FS 139.42
1328100684621877248 2020-11-15 14:20:52 -0800 <rockerskating> Bradie Tennell / Team Tara 3Lz3T, 2A, 3Lo, 3S, 3Lz(ur?)3T(ur), 2A, 2F2T2Lo - strange that the flip has been messing with her so far this season, a stronger skate than she had at Skate America TES 68.80, PCS 71.34, FS 140.14
1328099692870324224 2020-11-15 14:16:56 -0800 <rockerskating> Alysa Liu / Team Johnny 1A, 3Lz, 2A2T, 2Lo, 3Lz(ur?)2T, 2F1Eu2S, 2F - popped way too many jumps, just hasn't had the snap this season that she had in the past; it's a long climb up to Nationals at this point, not even about the quads right now TES 48.93, PCS 61.87, FS 110.80
1328098539239518209 2020-11-15 14:12:21 -0800 <rockerskating> Audrey Shin / Team Tara 3Lz3T, 2A3T(ur?), 3S(ur), 3F(e?), 3Lz, 3Lo2T2Lo(ur), 2A - she continues to impress, and there is certainly podium potential for Shin at Nationals this season TES 67.19, PCS 65.46, FS 132.65
1328097603867848704 2020-11-15 14:08:38 -0800 <rockerskating> For folks who are wondering / asking, the Las Vegas Invitational was taped the Monday after Skate America happened, so no one traveled back to Vegas for this event - it all happened at the same time ... great opportunity to provide more athlete funding with competition time
1328097275680337922 2020-11-15 14:07:20 -0800 <rockerskating> Karen Chen / Team Johnny 2A2T, 3Lz, 3F(e?q?), 3Lo, 3Lz(ur)2T2Lo, 2S, 2Lo2T - not quite what she delivered at Skate America, which was probably her strongest skate in a while TES 55.50, PCS 66.93, FS 122.43
1328096404183674888 2020-11-15 14:03:52 -0800 <rockerskating> @Scott_D My tweeting is "live"
1328096320293318658 2020-11-15 14:03:32 -0800 <rockerskating> Starr Andrews / Team Tara 3F, 3S(hangs on), 3T3T, 2A, 3Lo2T2Lo(ur?), 2A, 3Lo(ur?ftdwn) - nicely skated, a couple of strong performances from Andrews with Skate America and this one TES 58.84, PCS 61.86, FS 120.70
1328095390671966210 2020-11-15 13:59:50 -0800 <rockerskating> This thread: Las Vegas International live - note that the PCS multiplier for the men and the women is the same to have their PCS counted the across disciplines #nohashtagsothereyougo

1325895002170515459 2020-11-09 12:16:17 -0800 <rockerskating> Impressions: The big drama music certainly works with the big jumps, though you can see a noticeable difference in her skating quality from her SP, which showcases her visible improvements since last year. The FS quality isn’t up to the standards we saw in the SP

1332604028979699715 2020-11-28 00:35:33 -0800 <rockerskating> I’ll say it again: the introduction of the q in the IJS is a step backward.

When you can exactly measure direction of takeoff w respect to blade positioning at landing, then let’s talk

1332222891858014209 2020-11-26 23:21:03 -0800 <rockerskating> Yeah, Marin Honda should be like 35 in PCS but they're not gonna give her that  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332222752145756160 2020-11-26 23:20:30 -0800 <rockerskating> Marin Honda JPN 3Lo2T, 3F(q?), 2A - gosh, looking so much stronger than even a couple weeks ago at Sectionals, good to see her on the way back up from her shoulder dislocation a couple months ago; this program is a beauty  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332222079022804994 2020-11-26 23:17:49 -0800 <rockerskating> I still have no idea why Tomoe Kawabata was under 30 in PCS  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332221213104599045 2020-11-26 23:14:23 -0800 <rockerskating> Mako Yamashita JPN 3Lo, 2A, 3Lz3T - strong skate for Yamashita, she's definitely grown into this program but I've just never figured out how to get into this version of this aria  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332215668486320129 2020-11-26 22:52:21 -0800 <rockerskating> Tomoe Kawabata JPN 3Lz3T, 3Lo(turn), 2A(step) - even with that turnout on the loop, I'd very much have this program in front, Kawabata's skating is heads above the rest so far ... and then the axel stepout (sigh)  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332215261827633153 2020-11-26 22:50:44 -0800 <rockerskating> Wow, the reset on the slightly overrotated lutz to launch the 3T was so good from Kawabata - that combo could've really gone off the rails  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332209954686701568 2020-11-26 22:29:39 -0800 <rockerskating> Ok, the fact that an international unknown like Rino Matsuike got ~30 on PCS gives me hope that they might not lowball their top skaters on PCS after all  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1331760335330668545 2020-11-25 16:43:01 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 @JohnWilsonBlade @edeaskates The reason I say go with rentals first is because breaking in boots is a whole different thing in itself. It requires you to be pretty steady on skates because it’s real tough to learn how to skate in new boots
1331760100965572610 2020-11-25 16:42:05 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 Then talk to your coach / pro shop about it. I’ve always been with @JohnWilsonBlade from beginner standard blades to advanced double/triple jump blades. I got into @edeaskates boots very recently and I really like them, but they are different than normal
1331759634907099138 2020-11-25 16:40:14 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 Gotta say, I’m not the most knowledgeable about where to start (I don’t even remember how I got started with skates - I think my group lessons coach just said, go get these!). If I were you, I would start with rental skates first and get used to skating / take some lessons
1331731738742108163 2020-11-25 14:49:23 -0800 <rockerskating> Still life of skate and blade  https://t.co/3CrVksvzop
1331588472239480833 2020-11-25 05:20:06 -0800 <rockerskating> First thought this morning: Daisuke Takahashi is making his ice dance debut this week  https://t.co/DdMSAcDOK5
1331447042762280960 2020-11-24 19:58:06 -0800 <rockerskating> @Jacqueline4Fun Haha this was a very standard toe loop entry for a really long time ... hasn’t been the case for prob the past 15-20 years
1331438425015267328 2020-11-24 19:23:52 -0800 <rockerskating> @aprimo224 He did. But this post is about Urmanov’s 4T and I didn’t say anything about this being the first quad toe.
1331437373088002048 2020-11-24 19:19:41 -0800 <rockerskating> For some reason, my walk down memory lane went On Golden Pond - this program keeps moving upward in my list of great programs of all time:  https://t.co/bAWLFbkUQd
1331430276682039299 2020-11-24 18:51:29 -0800 <rockerskating> This quad toe is almost 30 years old. Alexei Urmanov - 1991 Worlds  https://t.co/6KcGgow8Zm

1330968023835013121 2020-11-23 12:14:39 -0800 <rockerskating> @SASgrafix @grasshopperay You can do triple-triple-triple, but it doesn’t make sense from a calculation standpoint. I wrote a whole tome on it at the Olympics:  https://t.co/uI4yKxpIUA
1330739202913398786 2020-11-22 21:05:24 -0800 <rockerskating> @BrownJefe I just rewatched both Euros and Worlds versions. The flip in both programs almost identical :(
1330739043265617921 2020-11-22 21:04:46 -0800 <rockerskating> @grasshopperay @SASgrafix I mean, technically it’s not “disallowed” - it’s more than only the first 3 jumps will count toward the combo
1330720087175819264 2020-11-22 19:49:27 -0800 <rockerskating> @BrownJefe I’m still sad she fell on that 3F in 1994 in her FS and it kept her off the Worlds podium
1330714299745120262 2020-11-22 19:26:27 -0800 <rockerskating> @VM2022Beijing Marina Kielmann. This was in 1993, so I think Slutskaya was 12 or 13 at this point
1330671501234892800 2020-11-22 16:36:23 -0800 <rockerskating> @SASgrafix Even better 2A1Lo1Lo2Lo1Lo2Lo combo

1330342778652520450 2020-11-21 18:50:09 -0800 <rockerskating> Still.
1330322752444706820 2020-11-21 17:30:35 -0800 <rockerskating> Yes they can, especially for someone whose needs to concentrate on their skating skills to make them good. Taking the time to focus on edge quality and power stroking is an art in itself. It’s not a given.
1330296885173768197 2020-11-21 15:47:47 -0800 <rockerskating> @katrenmet It indicates that it's a sequence (not a combo), which means the base value is calculated differently - combo is 100% of the jumps added together, sequence is 80% of the jumps added together
1330295011188105216 2020-11-21 15:40:21 -0800 <rockerskating> @JohnWilsonBlade It's them blades, isn't it?

1332604028979699715 2020-11-28 00:35:33 -0800 <rockerskating> I’ll say it again: the introduction of the q in the IJS is a step backward.

1332222891858014209 2020-11-26 23:21:03 -0800 <rockerskating> Yeah, Marin Honda should be like 35 in PCS but they're not gonna give her that  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332222752145756160 2020-11-26 23:20:30 -0800 <rockerskating> Marin Honda JPN 3Lo2T, 3F(q?), 2A - gosh, looking so much stronger than even a couple weeks ago at Sectionals, good to see her on the way back up from her shoulder dislocation a couple months ago; this program is a beauty  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332222079022804994 2020-11-26 23:17:49 -0800 <rockerskating> I still have no idea why Tomoe Kawabata was under 30 in PCS  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332221213104599045 2020-11-26 23:14:23 -0800 <rockerskating> Mako Yamashita JPN 3Lo, 2A, 3Lz3T - strong skate for Yamashita, she's definitely grown into this program but I've just never figured out how to get into this version of this aria  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332216613421146112 2020-11-26 22:56:06 -0800 <rockerskating> Tomoe Kawabata JPN 3Lz3T(q?), 3Lo(turn), 2A(step) TES 30.75, PCS 29.08, SP 59.83 into 3rd - I don't agree with those PCS at all, should've been over 30 for sure  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332215668486320129 2020-11-26 22:52:21 -0800 <rockerskating> Tomoe Kawabata JPN 3Lz3T, 3Lo(turn), 2A(step) - even with that turnout on the loop, I'd very much have this program in front, Kawabata's skating is heads above the rest so far ... and then the axel stepout (sigh)  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332215261827633153 2020-11-26 22:50:44 -0800 <rockerskating> Wow, the reset on the slightly overrotated lutz to launch the 3T was so good from Kawabata - that combo could've really gone off the rails  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332209954686701568 2020-11-26 22:29:39 -0800 <rockerskating> Ok, the fact that an international unknown like Rino Matsuike got ~30 on PCS gives me hope that they might not lowball their top skaters on PCS after all  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1331760335330668545 2020-11-25 16:43:01 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 @JohnWilsonBlade @edeaskates The reason I say go with rentals first is because breaking in boots is a whole different thing in itself. It requires you to be pretty steady on skates because it’s real tough to learn how to skate in new boots
1331760100965572610 2020-11-25 16:42:05 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 Then talk to your coach / pro shop about it. I’ve always been with @JohnWilsonBlade from beginner standard blades to advanced double/triple jump blades. I got into @edeaskates boots very recently and I really like them, but they are different than normal
1331759634907099138 2020-11-25 16:40:14 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 Gotta say, I’m not the most knowledgeable about where to start (I don’t even remember how I got started with skates - I think my group lessons coach just said, go get these!). If I were you, I would start with rental skates first and get used to skating / take some lessons
1331731738742108163 2020-11-25 14:49:23 -0800 <rockerskating> Still life of skate and blade  https://t.co/3CrVksvzop
1331588472239480833 2020-11-25 05:20:06 -0800 <rockerskating> First thought this morning: Daisuke Takahashi is making his ice dance debut this week  https://t.co/DdMSAcDOK5
1331447042762280960 2020-11-24 19:58:06 -0800 <rockerskating> @Jacqueline4Fun Haha this was a very standard toe loop entry for a really long time ... hasn’t been the case for prob the past 15-20 years
1331438425015267328 2020-11-24 19:23:52 -0800 <rockerskating> @aprimo224 He did. But this post is about Urmanov’s 4T and I didn’t say anything about this being the first quad toe.
1331437373088002048 2020-11-24 19:19:41 -0800 <rockerskating> For some reason, my walk down memory lane went On Golden Pond - this program keeps moving upward in my list of great programs of all time:  https://t.co/bAWLFbkUQd
1331430276682039299 2020-11-24 18:51:29 -0800 <rockerskating> This quad toe is almost 30 years old. Alexei Urmanov - 1991 Worlds  https://t.co/6KcGgow8Zm

1330968023835013121 2020-11-23 12:14:39 -0800 <rockerskating> @SASgrafix @grasshopperay You can do triple-triple-triple, but it doesn’t make sense from a calculation standpoint. I wrote a whole tome on it at the Olympics:  https://t.co/uI4yKxpIUA
1330739202913398786 2020-11-22 21:05:24 -0800 <rockerskating> @BrownJefe I just rewatched both Euros and Worlds versions. The flip in both programs almost identical :(
1330739043265617921 2020-11-22 21:04:46 -0800 <rockerskating> @grasshopperay @SASgrafix I mean, technically it’s not “disallowed” - it’s more than only the first 3 jumps will count toward the combo
1330720087175819264 2020-11-22 19:49:27 -0800 <rockerskating> @BrownJefe I’m still sad she fell on that 3F in 1994 in her FS and it kept her off the Worlds podium
1330714299745120262 2020-11-22 19:26:27 -0800 <rockerskating> @VM2022Beijing Marina Kielmann. This was in 1993, so I think Slutskaya was 12 or 13 at this point
1330671501234892800 2020-11-22 16:36:23 -0800 <rockerskating> @SASgrafix Even better 2A1Lo1Lo2Lo1Lo2Lo combo

1330342778652520450 2020-11-21 18:50:09 -0800 <rockerskating> Still.
1330322752444706820 2020-11-21 17:30:35 -0800 <rockerskating> Yes they can, especially for someone whose needs to concentrate on their skating skills to make them good. Taking the time to focus on edge quality and power stroking is an art in itself. It’s not a given.
1330296885173768197 2020-11-21 15:47:47 -0800 <rockerskating> @katrenmet It indicates that it's a sequence (not a combo), which means the base value is calculated differently - combo is 100% of the jumps added together, sequence is 80% of the jumps added together
1330295011188105216 2020-11-21 15:40:21 -0800 <rockerskating> @JohnWilsonBlade It's them blades, isn't it?

1332604028979699715 2020-11-28 00:35:33 -0800 <rockerskating> I’ll say it again: the introduction of the q in the IJS is a step backward.

When you can exactly measure direction of takeoff w respect to blade positioning at landing, then let’s talk

1332222752145756160 2020-11-26 23:20:30 -0800 <rockerskating> Marin Honda JPN 3Lo2T, 3F(q?), 2A - gosh, looking so much stronger than even a couple weeks ago at Sectionals, good to see her on the way back up from her shoulder dislocation a couple months ago; this program is a beauty  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332222079022804994 2020-11-26 23:17:49 -0800 <rockerskating> I still have no idea why Tomoe Kawabata was under 30 in PCS  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332221213104599045 2020-11-26 23:14:23 -0800 <rockerskating> Mako Yamashita JPN 3Lo, 2A, 3Lz3T - strong skate for Yamashita, she's definitely grown into this program but I've just never figured out how to get into this version of this aria  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332218626045317120 2020-11-26 23:04:06 -0800 <rockerskating> Rino Matsuike 65.74, Mana Kawabe 63.62, Mai Mihara 63.41 lead after 1st group; next 6: Mako Yamashita, Marin Honda, Yuhana Yokoi, Wakaba Higuchi, Young You, Kaori Sakamoto  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332216613421146112 2020-11-26 22:56:06 -0800 <rockerskating> Tomoe Kawabata JPN 3Lz3T(q?), 3Lo(turn), 2A(step) TES 30.75, PCS 29.08, SP 59.83 into 3rd - I don't agree with those PCS at all, should've been over 30 for sure  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332215668486320129 2020-11-26 22:52:21 -0800 <rockerskating> Tomoe Kawabata JPN 3Lz3T, 3Lo(turn), 2A(step) - even with that turnout on the loop, I'd very much have this program in front, Kawabata's skating is heads above the rest so far ... and then the axel stepout (sigh)  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332215261827633153 2020-11-26 22:50:44 -0800 <rockerskating> Wow, the reset on the slightly overrotated lutz to launch the 3T was so good from Kawabata - that combo could've really gone off the rails  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332209954686701568 2020-11-26 22:29:39 -0800 <rockerskating> Ok, the fact that an international unknown like Rino Matsuike got ~30 on PCS gives me hope that they might not lowball their top skaters on PCS after all  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1331760335330668545 2020-11-25 16:43:01 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 @JohnWilsonBlade @edeaskates The reason I say go with rentals first is because breaking in boots is a whole different thing in itself. It requires you to be pretty steady on skates because it’s real tough to learn how to skate in new boots
1331760100965572610 2020-11-25 16:42:05 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 Then talk to your coach / pro shop about it. I’ve always been with @JohnWilsonBlade from beginner standard blades to advanced double/triple jump blades. I got into @edeaskates boots very recently and I really like them, but they are different than normal
1331759634907099138 2020-11-25 16:40:14 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 Gotta say, I’m not the most knowledgeable about where to start (I don’t even remember how I got started with skates - I think my group lessons coach just said, go get these!). If I were you, I would start with rental skates first and get used to skating / take some lessons
1331731738742108163 2020-11-25 14:49:23 -0800 <rockerskating> Still life of skate and blade  https://t.co/3CrVksvzop
1331588472239480833 2020-11-25 05:20:06 -0800 <rockerskating> First thought this morning: Daisuke Takahashi is making his ice dance debut this week  https://t.co/DdMSAcDOK5
1331447042762280960 2020-11-24 19:58:06 -0800 <rockerskating> @Jacqueline4Fun Haha this was a very standard toe loop entry for a really long time ... hasn’t been the case for prob the past 15-20 years
1331438425015267328 2020-11-24 19:23:52 -0800 <rockerskating> @aprimo224 He did. But this post is about Urmanov’s 4T and I didn’t say anything about this being the first quad toe.
1331437373088002048 2020-11-24 19:19:41 -0800 <rockerskating> For some reason, my walk down memory lane went On Golden Pond - this program keeps moving upward in my list of great programs of all time:  https://t.co/bAWLFbkUQd
1331430276682039299 2020-11-24 18:51:29 -0800 <rockerskating> This quad toe is almost 30 years old. Alexei Urmanov - 1991 Worlds  https://t.co/6KcGgow8Zm

1330968023835013121 2020-11-23 12:14:39 -0800 <rockerskating> @SASgrafix @grasshopperay You can do triple-triple-triple, but it doesn’t make sense from a calculation standpoint. I wrote a whole tome on it at the Olympics:  https://t.co/uI4yKxpIUA
1330739202913398786 2020-11-22 21:05:24 -0800 <rockerskating> @BrownJefe I just rewatched both Euros and Worlds versions. The flip in both programs almost identical :(
1330739043265617921 2020-11-22 21:04:46 -0800 <rockerskating> @grasshopperay @SASgrafix I mean, technically it’s not “disallowed” - it’s more than only the first 3 jumps will count toward the combo
1330720087175819264 2020-11-22 19:49:27 -0800 <rockerskating> @BrownJefe I’m still sad she fell on that 3F in 1994 in her FS and it kept her off the Worlds podium
1330714299745120262 2020-11-22 19:26:27 -0800 <rockerskating> @VM2022Beijing Marina Kielmann. This was in 1993, so I think Slutskaya was 12 or 13 at this point
1330671501234892800 2020-11-22 16:36:23 -0800 <rockerskating> @SASgrafix Even better 2A1Lo1Lo2Lo1Lo2Lo combo

1330342778652520450 2020-11-21 18:50:09 -0800 <rockerskating> Still.
1330322752444706820 2020-11-21 17:30:35 -0800 <rockerskating> Yes they can, especially for someone whose needs to concentrate on their skating skills to make them good. Taking the time to focus on edge quality and power stroking is an art in itself. It’s not a given.
1330296885173768197 2020-11-21 15:47:47 -0800 <rockerskating> @katrenmet It indicates that it's a sequence (not a combo), which means the base value is calculated differently - combo is 100% of the jumps added together, sequence is 80% of the jumps added together
1330295011188105216 2020-11-21 15:40:21 -0800 <rockerskating> @JohnWilsonBlade It's them blades, isn't it?

1332604028979699715 2020-11-28 00:35:33 -0800 <rockerskating> I’ll say it again: the introduction of the q in the IJS is a step backward.

When you can exactly measure direction of takeoff w respect to blade positioning at landing, then let’s talk

1332222891858014209 2020-11-26 23:21:03 -0800 <rockerskating> Yeah, Marin Honda should be like 35 in PCS but they're not gonna give her that  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332222752145756160 2020-11-26 23:20:30 -0800 <rockerskating> Marin Honda JPN 3Lo2T, 3F(q?), 2A - gosh, looking so much stronger than even a couple weeks ago at Sectionals, good to see her on the way back up from her shoulder dislocation a couple months ago; this program is a beauty  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332222079022804994 2020-11-26 23:17:49 -0800 <rockerskating> I still have no idea why Tomoe Kawabata was under 30 in PCS  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332221213104599045 2020-11-26 23:14:23 -0800 <rockerskating> Mako Yamashita JPN 3Lo, 2A, 3Lz3T - strong skate for Yamashita, she's definitely grown into this program but I've just never figured out how to get into this version of this aria  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332215668486320129 2020-11-26 22:52:21 -0800 <rockerskating> Tomoe Kawabata JPN 3Lz3T, 3Lo(turn), 2A(step) - even with that turnout on the loop, I'd very much have this program in front, Kawabata's skating is heads above the rest so far ... and then the axel stepout (sigh)  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332215261827633153 2020-11-26 22:50:44 -0800 <rockerskating> Wow, the reset on the slightly overrotated lutz to launch the 3T was so good from Kawabata - that combo could've really gone off the rails  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332209954686701568 2020-11-26 22:29:39 -0800 <rockerskating> Ok, the fact that an international unknown like Rino Matsuike got ~30 on PCS gives me hope that they might not lowball their top skaters on PCS after all  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1331760335330668545 2020-11-25 16:43:01 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 @JohnWilsonBlade @edeaskates The reason I say go with rentals first is because breaking in boots is a whole different thing in itself. It requires you to be pretty steady on skates because it’s real tough to learn how to skate in new boots
1331760100965572610 2020-11-25 16:42:05 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 Then talk to your coach / pro shop about it. I’ve always been with @JohnWilsonBlade from beginner standard blades to advanced double/triple jump blades. I got into @edeaskates boots very recently and I really like them, but they are different than normal
1331759634907099138 2020-11-25 16:40:14 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 Gotta say, I’m not the most knowledgeable about where to start (I don’t even remember how I got started with skates - I think my group lessons coach just said, go get these!). If I were you, I would start with rental skates first and get used to skating / take some lessons
1331731738742108163 2020-11-25 14:49:23 -0800 <rockerskating> Still life of skate and blade  https://t.co/3CrVksvzop
1331588472239480833 2020-11-25 05:20:06 -0800 <rockerskating> First thought this morning: Daisuke Takahashi is making his ice dance debut this week  https://t.co/DdMSAcDOK5
1331447042762280960 2020-11-24 19:58:06 -0800 <rockerskating> @Jacqueline4Fun Haha this was a very standard toe loop entry for a really long time ... hasn’t been the case for prob the past 15-20 years
1331438425015267328 2020-11-24 19:23:52 -0800 <rockerskating> @aprimo224 He did. But this post is about Urmanov’s 4T and I didn’t say anything about this being the first quad toe.
1331437373088002048 2020-11-24 19:19:41 -0800 <rockerskating> For some reason, my walk down memory lane went On Golden Pond - this program keeps moving upward in my list of great programs of all time:  https://t.co/bAWLFbkUQd
1331430276682039299 2020-11-24 18:51:29 -0800 <rockerskating> This quad toe is almost 30 years old. Alexei Urmanov - 1991 Worlds  https://t.co/6KcGgow8Zm

1330968023835013121 2020-11-23 12:14:39 -0800 <rockerskating> @SASgrafix @grasshopperay You can do triple-triple-triple, but it doesn’t make sense from a calculation standpoint. I wrote a whole tome on it at the Olympics:  https://t.co/uI4yKxpIUA
1330739202913398786 2020-11-22 21:05:24 -0800 <rockerskating> @BrownJefe I just rewatched both Euros and Worlds versions. The flip in both programs almost identical :(
1330739043265617921 2020-11-22 21:04:46 -0800 <rockerskating> @grasshopperay @SASgrafix I mean, technically it’s not “disallowed” - it’s more than only the first 3 jumps will count toward the combo
1330720087175819264 2020-11-22 19:49:27 -0800 <rockerskating> @BrownJefe I’m still sad she fell on that 3F in 1994 in her FS and it kept her off the Worlds podium
1330714299745120262 2020-11-22 19:26:27 -0800 <rockerskating> @VM2022Beijing Marina Kielmann. This was in 1993, so I think Slutskaya was 12 or 13 at this point
1330671501234892800 2020-11-22 16:36:23 -0800 <rockerskating> @SASgrafix Even better 2A1Lo1Lo2Lo1Lo2Lo combo

1330342778652520450 2020-11-21 18:50:09 -0800 <rockerskating> Still.
1330322752444706820 2020-11-21 17:30:35 -0800 <rockerskating> Yes they can, especially for someone whose needs to concentrate on their skating skills to make them good. Taking the time to focus on edge quality and power stroking is an art in itself. It’s not a given.
1330296885173768197 2020-11-21 15:47:47 -0800 <rockerskating> @katrenmet It indicates that it's a sequence (not a combo), which means the base value is calculated differently - combo is 100% of the jumps added together, sequence is 80% of the jumps added together
1330295011188105216 2020-11-21 15:40:21 -0800 <rockerskating> @JohnWilsonBlade It's them blades, isn't it?

1332604028979699715 2020-11-28 00:35:33 -0800 <rockerskating> I’ll say it again: the introduction of the q in the IJS is a step backward.

1332222891858014209 2020-11-26 23:21:03 -0800 <rockerskating> Yeah, Marin Honda should be like 35 in PCS but they're not gonna give her that  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332222752145756160 2020-11-26 23:20:30 -0800 <rockerskating> Marin Honda JPN 3Lo2T, 3F(q?), 2A - gosh, looking so much stronger than even a couple weeks ago at Sectionals, good to see her on the way back up from her shoulder dislocation a couple months ago; this program is a beauty  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332222079022804994 2020-11-26 23:17:49 -0800 <rockerskating> I still have no idea why Tomoe Kawabata was under 30 in PCS  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332221213104599045 2020-11-26 23:14:23 -0800 <rockerskating> Mako Yamashita JPN 3Lo, 2A, 3Lz3T - strong skate for Yamashita, she's definitely grown into this program but I've just never figured out how to get into this version of this aria  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332216613421146112 2020-11-26 22:56:06 -0800 <rockerskating> Tomoe Kawabata JPN 3Lz3T(q?), 3Lo(turn), 2A(step) TES 30.75, PCS 29.08, SP 59.83 into 3rd - I don't agree with those PCS at all, should've been over 30 for sure  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332215668486320129 2020-11-26 22:52:21 -0800 <rockerskating> Tomoe Kawabata JPN 3Lz3T, 3Lo(turn), 2A(step) - even with that turnout on the loop, I'd very much have this program in front, Kawabata's skating is heads above the rest so far ... and then the axel stepout (sigh)  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332215261827633153 2020-11-26 22:50:44 -0800 <rockerskating> Wow, the reset on the slightly overrotated lutz to launch the 3T was so good from Kawabata - that combo could've really gone off the rails  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332209954686701568 2020-11-26 22:29:39 -0800 <rockerskating> Ok, the fact that an international unknown like Rino Matsuike got ~30 on PCS gives me hope that they might not lowball their top skaters on PCS after all  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1331760335330668545 2020-11-25 16:43:01 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 @JohnWilsonBlade @edeaskates The reason I say go with rentals first is because breaking in boots is a whole different thing in itself. It requires you to be pretty steady on skates because it’s real tough to learn how to skate in new boots
1331760100965572610 2020-11-25 16:42:05 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 Then talk to your coach / pro shop about it. I’ve always been with @JohnWilsonBlade from beginner standard blades to advanced double/triple jump blades. I got into @edeaskates boots very recently and I really like them, but they are different than normal
1331759634907099138 2020-11-25 16:40:14 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 Gotta say, I’m not the most knowledgeable about where to start (I don’t even remember how I got started with skates - I think my group lessons coach just said, go get these!). If I were you, I would start with rental skates first and get used to skating / take some lessons
1331731738742108163 2020-11-25 14:49:23 -0800 <rockerskating> Still life of skate and blade  https://t.co/3CrVksvzop
1331588472239480833 2020-11-25 05:20:06 -0800 <rockerskating> First thought this morning: Daisuke Takahashi is making his ice dance debut this week  https://t.co/DdMSAcDOK5
1331447042762280960 2020-11-24 19:58:06 -0800 <rockerskating> @Jacqueline4Fun Haha this was a very standard toe loop entry for a really long time ... hasn’t been the case for prob the past 15-20 years
1331438425015267328 2020-11-24 19:23:52 -0800 <rockerskating> @aprimo224 He did. But this post is about Urmanov’s 4T and I didn’t say anything about this being the first quad toe.
1331437373088002048 2020-11-24 19:19:41 -0800 <rockerskating> For some reason, my walk down memory lane went On Golden Pond - this program keeps moving upward in my list of great programs of all time:  https://t.co/bAWLFbkUQd
1331430276682039299 2020-11-24 18:51:29 -0800 <rockerskating> This quad toe is almost 30 years old. Alexei Urmanov - 1991 Worlds  https://t.co/6KcGgow8Zm

1330968023835013121 2020-11-23 12:14:39 -0800 <rockerskating> @SASgrafix @grasshopperay You can do triple-triple-triple, but it doesn’t make sense from a calculation standpoint. I wrote a whole tome on it at the Olympics:  https://t.co/uI4yKxpIUA
1330739202913398786 2020-11-22 21:05:24 -0800 <rockerskating> @BrownJefe I just rewatched both Euros and Worlds versions. The flip in both programs almost identical :(
1330739043265617921 2020-11-22 21:04:46 -0800 <rockerskating> @grasshopperay @SASgrafix I mean, technically it’s not “disallowed” - it’s more than only the first 3 jumps will count toward the combo
1330720087175819264 2020-11-22 19:49:27 -0800 <rockerskating> @BrownJefe I’m still sad she fell on that 3F in 1994 in her FS and it kept her off the Worlds podium
1330714299745120262 2020-11-22 19:26:27 -0800 <rockerskating> @VM2022Beijing Marina Kielmann. This was in 1993, so I think Slutskaya was 12 or 13 at this point
1330671501234892800 2020-11-22 16:36:23 -0800 <rockerskating> @SASgrafix Even better 2A1Lo1Lo2Lo1Lo2Lo combo

1330342778652520450 2020-11-21 18:50:09 -0800 <rockerskating> Still.
1330322752444706820 2020-11-21 17:30:35 -0800 <rockerskating> Yes they can, especially for someone whose needs to concentrate on their skating skills to make them good. Taking the time to focus on edge quality and power stroking is an art in itself. It’s not a given.
1330296885173768197 2020-11-21 15:47:47 -0800 <rockerskating> @katrenmet It indicates that it's a sequence (not a combo), which means the base value is calculated differently - combo is 100% of the jumps added together, sequence is 80% of the jumps added together
1330295011188105216 2020-11-21 15:40:21 -0800 <rockerskating> @JohnWilsonBlade It's them blades, isn't it?

1332604028979699715 2020-11-28 00:35:33 -0800 <rockerskating> I’ll say it again: the introduction of the q in the IJS is a step backward.

1332215261827633153 2020-11-26 22:50:44 -0800 <rockerskating> Wow, the reset on the slightly overrotated lutz to launch the 3T was so good from Kawabata - that combo could've really gone off the rails  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1331760335330668545 2020-11-25 16:43:01 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 @JohnWilsonBlade @edeaskates The reason I say go with rentals first is because breaking in boots is a whole different thing in itself. It requires you to be pretty steady on skates because it’s real tough to learn how to skate in new boots
1331760100965572610 2020-11-25 16:42:05 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 Then talk to your coach / pro shop about it. I’ve always been with @JohnWilsonBlade from beginner standard blades to advanced double/triple jump blades. I got into @edeaskates boots very recently and I really like them, but they are different than normal
1331759634907099138 2020-11-25 16:40:14 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 Gotta say, I’m not the most knowledgeable about where to start (I don’t even remember how I got started with skates - I think my group lessons coach just said, go get these!). If I were you, I would start with rental skates first and get used to skating / take some lessons
1331731738742108163 2020-11-25 14:49:23 -0800 <rockerskating> Still life of skate and blade  https://t.co/3CrVksvzop

1331447042762280960 2020-11-24 19:58:06 -0800 <rockerskating> @Jacqueline4Fun Haha this was a very standard toe loop entry for a really long time ... hasn’t been the case for prob the past 15-20 years
1331438425015267328 2020-11-24 19:23:52 -0800 <rockerskating> @aprimo224 He did. But this post is about Urmanov’s 4T and I didn’t say anything about this being the first quad toe.
1331437373088002048 2020-11-24 19:19:41 -0800 <rockerskating> For some reason, my walk down memory lane went On Golden Pond - this program keeps moving upward in my list of great programs of all time:  https://t.co/bAWLFbkUQd
1331430276682039299 2020-11-24 18:51:29 -0800 <rockerskating> This quad toe is almost 30 years old. Alexei Urmanov - 1991 Worlds  https://t.co/6KcGgow8Zm

1330968023835013121 2020-11-23 12:14:39 -0800 <rockerskating> @SASgrafix @grasshopperay You can do triple-triple-triple, but it doesn’t make sense from a calculation standpoint. I wrote a whole tome on it at the Olympics:  https://t.co/uI4yKxpIUA
1330739202913398786 2020-11-22 21:05:24 -0800 <rockerskating> @BrownJefe I just rewatched both Euros and Worlds versions. The flip in both programs almost identical :(
1330739043265617921 2020-11-22 21:04:46 -0800 <rockerskating> @grasshopperay @SASgrafix I mean, technically it’s not “disallowed” - it’s more than only the first 3 jumps will count toward the combo
1330720087175819264 2020-11-22 19:49:27 -0800 <rockerskating> @BrownJefe I’m still sad she fell on that 3F in 1994 in her FS and it kept her off the Worlds podium
1330714299745120262 2020-11-22 19:26:27 -0800 <rockerskating> @VM2022Beijing Marina Kielmann. This was in 1993, so I think Slutskaya was 12 or 13 at this point
1330671501234892800 2020-11-22 16:36:23 -0800 <rockerskating> @SASgrafix Even better 2A1Lo1Lo2Lo1Lo2Lo combo

1330342778652520450 2020-11-21 18:50:09 -0800 <rockerskating> Still.
1330322752444706820 2020-11-21 17:30:35 -0800 <rockerskating> Yes they can, especially for someone whose needs to concentrate on their skating skills to make them good. Taking the time to focus on edge quality and power stroking is an art in itself. It’s not a given.
1330296885173768197 2020-11-21 15:47:47 -0800 <rockerskating> @katrenmet It indicates that it's a sequence (not a combo), which means the base value is calculated differently - combo is 100% of the jumps added together, sequence is 80% of the jumps added together
1330295011188105216 2020-11-21 15:40:21 -0800 <rockerskating> @JohnWilsonBlade It's them blades, isn't it?

1332604028979699715 2020-11-28 00:35:33 -0800 <rockerskating> I’ll say it again: the introduction of the q in the IJS is a step backward.

1332226319514480641 2020-11-26 23:34:40 -0800 <rockerskating> Wakaba Higuchi JPN 3A(q?fall), 3Lz3T, 3F(e?) - this program continues to get better and better; her decision to put the 3A in the SP shows how confident she must be on that jump in practice; hoping it'll hit tomorrow  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332225473758244864 2020-11-26 23:31:19 -0800 <rockerskating> I would've had Yokoi at least 3-4 points over Matsuike but ok  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332222891858014209 2020-11-26 23:21:03 -0800 <rockerskating> Yeah, Marin Honda should be like 35 in PCS but they're not gonna give her that  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332222079022804994 2020-11-26 23:17:49 -0800 <rockerskating> I still have no idea why Tomoe Kawabata was under 30 in PCS  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332216613421146112 2020-11-26 22:56:06 -0800 <rockerskating> Tomoe Kawabata JPN 3Lz3T(q?), 3Lo(turn), 2A(step) TES 30.75, PCS 29.08, SP 59.83 into 3rd - I don't agree with those PCS at all, should've been over 30 for sure  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332215668486320129 2020-11-26 22:52:21 -0800 <rockerskating> Tomoe Kawabata JPN 3Lz3T, 3Lo(turn), 2A(step) - even with that turnout on the loop, I'd very much have this program in front, Kawabata's skating is heads above the rest so far ... and then the axel stepout (sigh)  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332215261827633153 2020-11-26 22:50:44 -0800 <rockerskating> Wow, the reset on the slightly overrotated lutz to launch the 3T was so good from Kawabata - that combo could've really gone off the rails  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332209954686701568 2020-11-26 22:29:39 -0800 <rockerskating> Ok, the fact that an international unknown like Rino Matsuike got ~30 on PCS gives me hope that they might not lowball their top skaters on PCS after all  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1331760335330668545 2020-11-25 16:43:01 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 @JohnWilsonBlade @edeaskates The reason I say go with rentals first is because breaking in boots is a whole different thing in itself. It requires you to be pretty steady on skates because it’s real tough to learn how to skate in new boots
1331760100965572610 2020-11-25 16:42:05 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 Then talk to your coach / pro shop about it. I’ve always been with @JohnWilsonBlade from beginner standard blades to advanced double/triple jump blades. I got into @edeaskates boots very recently and I really like them, but they are different than normal
1331759634907099138 2020-11-25 16:40:14 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 Gotta say, I’m not the most knowledgeable about where to start (I don’t even remember how I got started with skates - I think my group lessons coach just said, go get these!). If I were you, I would start with rental skates first and get used to skating / take some lessons
1331731738742108163 2020-11-25 14:49:23 -0800 <rockerskating> Still life of skate and blade  https://t.co/3CrVksvzop

1331447042762280960 2020-11-24 19:58:06 -0800 <rockerskating> @Jacqueline4Fun Haha this was a very standard toe loop entry for a really long time ... hasn’t been the case for prob the past 15-20 years
1331438425015267328 2020-11-24 19:23:52 -0800 <rockerskating> @aprimo224 He did. But this post is about Urmanov’s 4T and I didn’t say anything about this being the first quad toe.
1331437373088002048 2020-11-24 19:19:41 -0800 <rockerskating> For some reason, my walk down memory lane went On Golden Pond - this program keeps moving upward in my list of great programs of all time:  https://t.co/bAWLFbkUQd
1331430276682039299 2020-11-24 18:51:29 -0800 <rockerskating> This quad toe is almost 30 years old. Alexei Urmanov - 1991 Worlds  https://t.co/6KcGgow8Zm

1330968023835013121 2020-11-23 12:14:39 -0800 <rockerskating> @SASgrafix @grasshopperay You can do triple-triple-triple, but it doesn’t make sense from a calculation standpoint. I wrote a whole tome on it at the Olympics:  https://t.co/uI4yKxpIUA
1330739202913398786 2020-11-22 21:05:24 -0800 <rockerskating> @BrownJefe I just rewatched both Euros and Worlds versions. The flip in both programs almost identical :(
1330739043265617921 2020-11-22 21:04:46 -0800 <rockerskating> @grasshopperay @SASgrafix I mean, technically it’s not “disallowed” - it’s more than only the first 3 jumps will count toward the combo
1330720087175819264 2020-11-22 19:49:27 -0800 <rockerskating> @BrownJefe I’m still sad she fell on that 3F in 1994 in her FS and it kept her off the Worlds podium
1330714299745120262 2020-11-22 19:26:27 -0800 <rockerskating> @VM2022Beijing Marina Kielmann. This was in 1993, so I think Slutskaya was 12 or 13 at this point
1330671501234892800 2020-11-22 16:36:23 -0800 <rockerskating> @SASgrafix Even better 2A1Lo1Lo2Lo1Lo2Lo combo

1330342778652520450 2020-11-21 18:50:09 -0800 <rockerskating> Still.
1330322752444706820 2020-11-21 17:30:35 -0800 <rockerskating> Yes they can, especially for someone whose needs to concentrate on their skating skills to make them good. Taking the time to focus on edge quality and power stroking is an art in itself. It’s not a given.
1330296885173768197 2020-11-21 15:47:47 -0800 <rockerskating> @katrenmet It indicates that it's a sequence (not a combo), which means the base value is calculated differently - combo is 100% of the jumps added together, sequence is 80% of the jumps added together
1330295011188105216 2020-11-21 15:40:21 -0800 <rockerskating> @JohnWilsonBlade It's them blades, isn't it?

1332604028979699715 2020-11-28 00:35:33 -0800 <rockerskating> I’ll say it again: the introduction of the q in the IJS is a step backward.   Calling a jump “exactly 1/4 rotation” short requires a level of precision that doesn’t exist. When you can exactly measure direction of takeoff w respect to blade positioning at landing, then let’s talk
1332602830910328832 2020-11-28 00:30:48 -0800 <rockerskating> I was totally offended by the PCS as well

1332599043697020928 2020-11-28 00:15:45 -0800 <rockerskating> Nobody has really been "ratifying" these next 3As, but if you go with the standard fully-rotated + non-negative GOEs, this doesn't make it - 3Aq is technically fully-rotated (full base value is given) but the average GOE given by the judges is -0.16  That said, #13 in my book
1332598522747772929 2020-11-28 00:13:40 -0800 <rockerskating> Kaori Sakamoto JPN 2A, 3F3T, 3Lz, 3S, 2A3T2T, 3F2T, 3Lo - FINALLY! feels like a long time since we've seen a clean FS fro Sakamoto, superb skate and well-deserved win  https://t.co/VVZtXCUy6N #NHK杯フィギュア #NHKTrophy20
1332598342573051905 2020-11-28 00:12:58 -0800 <rockerskating> @Erinsk8 Yes, it's a -2 to -3 off what the GOE otherwise would've been had the q not been called
1332597651594993667 2020-11-28 00:10:13 -0800 <rockerskating> A q is called when the jump is deemed "exactly 1/4 rotation" short (which, in itself, is ridiculous how precise the imprecision has to be) - the base value remains the same

1332596415588159488 2020-11-28 00:05:18 -0800 <rockerskating> I can't believe they gave it a q on replay.
1332596269278244864 2020-11-28 00:04:43 -0800 <rockerskating> Wakaba Higuchi 3A, 3Lz3T(hangs on), 2S(step), 3Lo, 2A3T, 3F2T2Lo, 2Lz - axel is under review, a couple of pops but a strong skate for Higuchi, will get her in front with Sakamoto left  https://t.co/VVZtXCUy6N #NHK杯フィギュア #NHKTrophy20

1331760335330668545 2020-11-25 16:43:01 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 @JohnWilsonBlade @edeaskates The reason I say go with rentals first is because breaking in boots is a whole different thing in itself. It requires you to be pretty steady on skates because it’s real tough to learn how to skate in new boots
1331760100965572610 2020-11-25 16:42:05 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 Then talk to your coach / pro shop about it. I’ve always been with @JohnWilsonBlade from beginner standard blades to advanced double/triple jump blades. I got into @edeaskates boots very recently and I really like them, but they are different than normal
1331759634907099138 2020-11-25 16:40:14 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 Gotta say, I’m not the most knowledgeable about where to start (I don’t even remember how I got started with skates - I think my group lessons coach just said, go get these!). If I were you, I would start with rental skates first and get used to skating / take some lessons

1331447042762280960 2020-11-24 19:58:06 -0800 <rockerskating> @Jacqueline4Fun Haha this was a very standard toe loop entry for a really long time ... hasn’t been the case for prob the past 15-20 years
1331438425015267328 2020-11-24 19:23:52 -0800 <rockerskating> @aprimo224 He did. But this post is about Urmanov’s 4T and I didn’t say anything about this being the first quad toe.
1331437373088002048 2020-11-24 19:19:41 -0800 <rockerskating> For some reason, my walk down memory lane went On Golden Pond - this program keeps moving upward in my list of great programs of all time:  https://t.co/bAWLFbkUQd

1330968023835013121 2020-11-23 12:14:39 -0800 <rockerskating> @SASgrafix @grasshopperay You can do triple-triple-triple, but it doesn’t make sense from a calculation standpoint. I wrote a whole tome on it at the Olympics:  https://t.co/uI4yKxpIUA
1330739202913398786 2020-11-22 21:05:24 -0800 <rockerskating> @BrownJefe I just rewatched both Euros and Worlds versions. The flip in both programs almost identical :(
1330739043265617921 2020-11-22 21:04:46 -0800 <rockerskating> @grasshopperay @SASgrafix I mean, technically it’s not “disallowed” - it’s more than only the first 3 jumps will count toward the combo
1330720087175819264 2020-11-22 19:49:27 -0800 <rockerskating> @BrownJefe I’m still sad she fell on that 3F in 1994 in her FS and it kept her off the Worlds podium
1330714299745120262 2020-11-22 19:26:27 -0800 <rockerskating> @VM2022Beijing Marina Kielmann. This was in 1993, so I think Slutskaya was 12 or 13 at this point
1330671501234892800 2020-11-22 16:36:23 -0800 <rockerskating> @SASgrafix Even better 2A1Lo1Lo2Lo1Lo2Lo combo

1330342778652520450 2020-11-21 18:50:09 -0800 <rockerskating> Still.
1330322752444706820 2020-11-21 17:30:35 -0800 <rockerskating> Yes they can, especially for someone whose needs to concentrate on their skating skills to make them good. Taking the time to focus on edge quality and power stroking is an art in itself. It’s not a given.
1330296885173768197 2020-11-21 15:47:47 -0800 <rockerskating> @katrenmet It indicates that it's a sequence (not a combo), which means the base value is calculated differently - combo is 100% of the jumps added together, sequence is 80% of the jumps added together
1330295011188105216 2020-11-21 15:40:21 -0800 <rockerskating> @JohnWilsonBlade It's them blades, isn't it?

1330205739390996481 2020-11-21 09:45:36 -0800 <rockerskating> When the mistakes happen, the wheels really come off the overall program for Trusova - there's no salvaging, and tbh, given all the improvements we saw in the short, this free should be 55 PCS max (but that won't happen)  https://t.co/NyesIGB64n #RostelecomCup2020 #GPFigure

1332604028979699715 2020-11-28 00:35:33 -0800 <rockerskating> I’ll say it again: the introduction of the q in the IJS is a step backward.   Calling a jump “exactly 1/4 rotation” short requires a level of precision that doesn’t exist. When you can exactly measure direction of takeoff w respect to blade positioning at landing, then let’s talk
1332602830910328832 2020-11-28 00:30:48 -0800 <rockerskating> I was totally offended by the PCS as well

1332599043697020928 2020-11-28 00:15:45 -0800 <rockerskating> Nobody has really been "ratifying" these next 3As, but if you go with the standard fully-rotated + non-negative GOEs, this doesn't make it - 3Aq is technically fully-rotated (full base value is given) but the average GOE given by the judges is -0.16  That said, #13 in my book
1332598522747772929 2020-11-28 00:13:40 -0800 <rockerskating> Kaori Sakamoto JPN 2A, 3F3T, 3Lz, 3S, 2A3T2T, 3F2T, 3Lo - FINALLY! feels like a long time since we've seen a clean FS fro Sakamoto, superb skate and well-deserved win  https://t.co/VVZtXCUy6N #NHK杯フィギュア #NHKTrophy20
1332598342573051905 2020-11-28 00:12:58 -0800 <rockerskating> @Erinsk8 Yes, it's a -2 to -3 off what the GOE otherwise would've been had the q not been called
1332597651594993667 2020-11-28 00:10:13 -0800 <rockerskating> A q is called when the jump is deemed "exactly 1/4 rotation" short (which, in itself, is ridiculous how precise the imprecision has to be) - the base value remains the same

1332596415588159488 2020-11-28 00:05:18 -0800 <rockerskating> I can't believe they gave it a q on replay.
1332596269278244864 2020-11-28 00:04:43 -0800 <rockerskating> Wakaba Higuchi 3A, 3Lz3T(hangs on), 2S(step), 3Lo, 2A3T, 3F2T2Lo, 2Lz - axel is under review, a couple of pops but a strong skate for Higuchi, will get her in front with Sakamoto left  https://t.co/VVZtXCUy6N #NHK杯フィギュア #NHKTrophy20

1331760335330668545 2020-11-25 16:43:01 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 @JohnWilsonBlade @edeaskates The reason I say go with rentals first is because breaking in boots is a whole different thing in itself. It requires you to be pretty steady on skates because it’s real tough to learn how to skate in new boots
1331760100965572610 2020-11-25 16:42:05 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 Then talk to your coach / pro shop about it. I’ve always been with @JohnWilsonBlade from beginner standard blades to advanced double/triple jump blades. I got into @edeaskates boots very recently and I really like them, but they are different than normal
1331759634907099138 2020-11-25 16:40:14 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 Gotta say, I’m not the most knowledgeable about where to start (I don’t even remember how I got started with skates - I think my group lessons coach just said, go get these!). If I were you, I would start with rental skates first and get used to skating / take some lessons

1331447042762280960 2020-11-24 19:58:06 -0800 <rockerskating> @Jacqueline4Fun Haha this was a very standard toe loop entry for a really long time ... hasn’t been the case for prob the past 15-20 years
1331438425015267328 2020-11-24 19:23:52 -0800 <rockerskating> @aprimo224 He did. But this post is about Urmanov’s 4T and I didn’t say anything about this being the first quad toe.
1331437373088002048 2020-11-24 19:19:41 -0800 <rockerskating> For some reason, my walk down memory lane went On Golden Pond - this program keeps moving upward in my list of great programs of all time:  https://t.co/bAWLFbkUQd

1330968023835013121 2020-11-23 12:14:39 -0800 <rockerskating> @SASgrafix @grasshopperay You can do triple-triple-triple, but it doesn’t make sense from a calculation standpoint. I wrote a whole tome on it at the Olympics:  https://t.co/uI4yKxpIUA
1330739202913398786 2020-11-22 21:05:24 -0800 <rockerskating> @BrownJefe I just rewatched both Euros and Worlds versions. The flip in both programs almost identical :(
1330739043265617921 2020-11-22 21:04:46 -0800 <rockerskating> @grasshopperay @SASgrafix I mean, technically it’s not “disallowed” - it’s more than only the first 3 jumps will count toward the combo
1330720087175819264 2020-11-22 19:49:27 -0800 <rockerskating> @BrownJefe I’m still sad she fell on that 3F in 1994 in her FS and it kept her off the Worlds podium
1330714299745120262 2020-11-22 19:26:27 -0800 <rockerskating> @VM2022Beijing Marina Kielmann. This was in 1993, so I think Slutskaya was 12 or 13 at this point
1330671501234892800 2020-11-22 16:36:23 -0800 <rockerskating> @SASgrafix Even better 2A1Lo1Lo2Lo1Lo2Lo combo

1330342778652520450 2020-11-21 18:50:09 -0800 <rockerskating> Still.
1330322752444706820 2020-11-21 17:30:35 -0800 <rockerskating> Yes they can, especially for someone whose needs to concentrate on their skating skills to make them good. Taking the time to focus on edge quality and power stroking is an art in itself. It’s not a given.
1330296885173768197 2020-11-21 15:47:47 -0800 <rockerskating> @katrenmet It indicates that it's a sequence (not a combo), which means the base value is calculated differently - combo is 100% of the jumps added together, sequence is 80% of the jumps added together
1330295011188105216 2020-11-21 15:40:21 -0800 <rockerskating> @JohnWilsonBlade It's them blades, isn't it?

1330205739390996481 2020-11-21 09:45:36 -0800 <rockerskating> When the mistakes happen, the wheels really come off the overall program for Trusova - there's no salvaging, and tbh, given all the improvements we saw in the short, this free should be 55 PCS max (but that won't happen)  https://t.co/NyesIGB64n #RostelecomCup2020 #GPFigure

1332604028979699715 2020-11-28 00:35:33 -0800 <rockerskating> I’ll say it again: the introduction of the q in the IJS is a step backward.

1332229397462605824 2020-11-26 23:46:54 -0800 <rockerskating> Kaori Sakamoto JPN 2A, 3Lz(e?), 3F3T - upgraded her program to backload the combo and put the lutz in over the loop; the lutz edge is still not totally reliable, but it's a good place to give it a shot; this will go into 1st  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

TES 38.75, PCS 31.96, -1.00, SP 69.71 into 1st - good lord, those PCS should've been 34-35, not because they need to be inflated but because that's what she deserves  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332226474447953922 2020-11-26 23:35:17 -0800 <rockerskating> Wakaba Higuchi should go in front with that program, but they are gonna be like, nah PCS tho  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332215668486320129 2020-11-26 22:52:21 -0800 <rockerskating> Tomoe Kawabata JPN 3Lz3T, 3Lo(turn), 2A(step) - even with that turnout on the loop, I'd very much have this program in front, Kawabata's skating is heads above the rest so far ... and then the axel stepout (sigh)  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332215261827633153 2020-11-26 22:50:44 -0800 <rockerskating> Wow, the reset on the slightly overrotated lutz to launch the 3T was so good from Kawabata - that combo could've really gone off the rails  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

It requires you to be pretty steady on skates because it’s real tough to learn how to skate in new boots
1331760100965572610 2020-11-25 16:42:05 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 Then talk to your coach / pro shop about it. I’ve always been with @JohnWilsonBlade from beginner standard blades to advanced double/triple jump blades. I got into @edeaskates boots very recently and I really like them, but they are different than normal
1331759634907099138 2020-11-25 16:40:14 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 Gotta say, I’m not the most knowledgeable about where to start (I don’t even remember how I got started with skates - I think my group lessons coach just said, go get these!). If I were you, I would start with rental skates first and get used to skating / take some lessons

1331447042762280960 2020-11-24 19:58:06 -0800 <rockerskating> @Jacqueline4Fun Haha this was a very standard toe loop entry for a really long time ... hasn’t been the case for prob the past 15-20 years
1331438425015267328 2020-11-24 19:23:52 -0800 <rockerskating> @aprimo224 He did. But this post is about Urmanov’s 4T and I didn’t say anything about this being the first quad toe.
1331437373088002048 2020-11-24 19:19:41 -0800 <rockerskating> For some reason, my walk down memory lane went On Golden Pond - this program keeps moving upward in my list of great programs of all time:  https://t.co/bAWLFbkUQd

1330970864695832579 2020-11-23 12:25:57 -0800 <rockerskating> @kmerriam2002 @wileywindymoors Haha yes! And Marina Kielmann started out roller skating, so there’s the connect
1330968023835013121 2020-11-23 12:14:39 -0800 <rockerskating> @SASgrafix @grasshopperay You can do triple-triple-triple, but it doesn’t make sense from a calculation standpoint. I wrote a whole tome on it at the Olympics:  https://t.co/uI4yKxpIUA
1330739202913398786 2020-11-22 21:05:24 -0800 <rockerskating> @BrownJefe I just rewatched both Euros and Worlds versions. The flip in both programs almost identical :(
1330739043265617921 2020-11-22 21:04:46 -0800 <rockerskating> @grasshopperay @SASgrafix I mean, technically it’s not “disallowed” - it’s more than only the first 3 jumps will count toward the combo
1330720087175819264 2020-11-22 19:49:27 -0800 <rockerskating> @BrownJefe I’m still sad she fell on that 3F in 1994 in her FS and it kept her off the Worlds podium

1330296885173768197 2020-11-21 15:47:47 -0800 <rockerskating> @katrenmet It indicates that it's a sequence (not a combo), which means the base value is calculated differently - combo is 100% of the jumps added together, sequence is 80% of the jumps added together

1332229397462605824 2020-11-26 23:46:54 -0800 <rockerskating> Kaori Sakamoto JPN 2A, 3Lz(e?), 3F3T - upgraded her program to backload the combo and put the lutz in over the loop; the lutz edge is still not totally reliable, but it's a good place to give it a shot; this will go into 1st  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332228781168353280 2020-11-26 23:44:27 -0800 <rockerskating> Young You KOR 3A(ur,fall), 3Lz(ur?fall), 3F3T(ur) TES 28.28, PCS 29.28, -2.00, SP 55.56 into 11th - all three passes looked under, and who would've thought You would potentially be last going into the free?  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

TES 38.75, PCS 31.96, -1.00, SP 69.71 into 1st - good lord, those PCS should've been 34-35, not because they need to be inflated but because that's what she deserves  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332226474447953922 2020-11-26 23:35:17 -0800 <rockerskating> Wakaba Higuchi should go in front with that program, but they are gonna be like, nah PCS tho  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332226319514480641 2020-11-26 23:34:40 -0800 <rockerskating> Wakaba Higuchi JPN 3A(q?fall), 3Lz3T, 3F(e?) - this program continues to get better and better; her decision to put the 3A in the SP shows how confident she must be on that jump in practice; hoping it'll hit tomorrow  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332225473758244864 2020-11-26 23:31:19 -0800 <rockerskating> I would've had Yokoi at least 3-4 points over Matsuike but ok  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332222891858014209 2020-11-26 23:21:03 -0800 <rockerskating> Yeah, Marin Honda should be like 35 in PCS but they're not gonna give her that  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332222079022804994 2020-11-26 23:17:49 -0800 <rockerskating> I still have no idea why Tomoe Kawabata was under 30 in PCS  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332218626045317120 2020-11-26 23:04:06 -0800 <rockerskating> Rino Matsuike 65.74, Mana Kawabe 63.62, Mai Mihara 63.41 lead after 1st group; next 6: Mako Yamashita, Marin Honda, Yuhana Yokoi, Wakaba Higuchi, Young You, Kaori Sakamoto  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332217439757754370 2020-11-26 22:59:23 -0800 <rockerskating> Mai Mihara JPN 3Lz3T(q?), 2A, 3F(e?) - great to see her back in competition, feels like she hasn't yet gotten back the power that she used to have before the illness took her out of competition  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332216613421146112 2020-11-26 22:56:06 -0800 <rockerskating> Tomoe Kawabata JPN 3Lz3T(q?), 3Lo(turn), 2A(step) TES 30.75, PCS 29.08, SP 59.83 into 3rd - I don't agree with those PCS at all, should've been over 30 for sure  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332215668486320129 2020-11-26 22:52:21 -0800 <rockerskating> Tomoe Kawabata JPN 3Lz3T, 3Lo(turn), 2A(step) - even with that turnout on the loop, I'd very much have this program in front, Kawabata's skating is heads above the rest so far ... and then the axel stepout (sigh)  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332215261827633153 2020-11-26 22:50:44 -0800 <rockerskating> Wow, the reset on the slightly overrotated lutz to launch the 3T was so good from Kawabata - that combo could've really gone off the rails  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332209954686701568 2020-11-26 22:29:39 -0800 <rockerskating> Ok, the fact that an international unknown like Rino Matsuike got ~30 on PCS gives me hope that they might not lowball their top skaters on PCS after all  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1331760335330668545 2020-11-25 16:43:01 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 @JohnWilsonBlade @edeaskates The reason I say go with rentals first is because breaking in boots is a whole different thing in itself. It requires you to be pretty steady on skates because it’s real tough to learn how to skate in new boots
1331760100965572610 2020-11-25 16:42:05 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 Then talk to your coach / pro shop about it. I’ve always been with @JohnWilsonBlade from beginner standard blades to advanced double/triple jump blades. I got into @edeaskates boots very recently and I really like them, but they are different than normal
1331759634907099138 2020-11-25 16:40:14 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 Gotta say, I’m not the most knowledgeable about where to start (I don’t even remember how I got started with skates - I think my group lessons coach just said, go get these!). If I were you, I would start with rental skates first and get used to skating / take some lessons

1331447042762280960 2020-11-24 19:58:06 -0800 <rockerskating> @Jacqueline4Fun Haha this was a very standard toe loop entry for a really long time ... hasn’t been the case for prob the past 15-20 years
1331438425015267328 2020-11-24 19:23:52 -0800 <rockerskating> @aprimo224 He did. But this post is about Urmanov’s 4T and I didn’t say anything about this being the first quad toe.
1331437373088002048 2020-11-24 19:19:41 -0800 <rockerskating> For some reason, my walk down memory lane went On Golden Pond - this program keeps moving upward in my list of great programs of all time:  https://t.co/bAWLFbkUQd
1331430276682039299 2020-11-24 18:51:29 -0800 <rockerskating> This quad toe is almost 30 years old. Alexei Urmanov - 1991 Worlds  https://t.co/6KcGgow8Zm

1330995755549683712 2020-11-23 14:04:51 -0800 <rockerskating> @cali_pygian I, of course, didn’t hate it one bit
1330970864695832579 2020-11-23 12:25:57 -0800 <rockerskating> @kmerriam2002 @wileywindymoors Haha yes! And Marina Kielmann started out roller skating, so there’s the connect
1330968023835013121 2020-11-23 12:14:39 -0800 <rockerskating> @SASgrafix @grasshopperay You can do triple-triple-triple, but it doesn’t make sense from a calculation standpoint. I wrote a whole tome on it at the Olympics:  https://t.co/uI4yKxpIUA
1330739202913398786 2020-11-22 21:05:24 -0800 <rockerskating> @BrownJefe I just rewatched both Euros and Worlds versions. The flip in both programs almost identical :(
1330739043265617921 2020-11-22 21:04:46 -0800 <rockerskating> @grasshopperay @SASgrafix I mean, technically it’s not “disallowed” - it’s more than only the first 3 jumps will count toward the combo
1330720087175819264 2020-11-22 19:49:27 -0800 <rockerskating> @BrownJefe I’m still sad she fell on that 3F in 1994 in her FS and it kept her off the Worlds podium
1330714299745120262 2020-11-22 19:26:27 -0800 <rockerskating> @VM2022Beijing Marina Kielmann. This was in 1993, so I think Slutskaya was 12 or 13 at this point

1330296885173768197 2020-11-21 15:47:47 -0800 <rockerskating> @katrenmet It indicates that it's a sequence (not a combo), which means the base value is calculated differently - combo is 100% of the jumps added together, sequence is 80% of the jumps added together

1332604028979699715 2020-11-28 00:35:33 -0800 <rockerskating> I’ll say it again: the introduction of the q in the IJS is a step backward.

1332229397462605824 2020-11-26 23:46:54 -0800 <rockerskating> Kaori Sakamoto JPN 2A, 3Lz(e?), 3F3T - upgraded her program to backload the combo and put the lutz in over the loop; the lutz edge is still not totally reliable, but it's a good place to give it a shot; this will go into 1st  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332228781168353280 2020-11-26 23:44:27 -0800 <rockerskating> Young You KOR 3A(ur,fall), 3Lz(ur?fall), 3F3T(ur) TES 28.28, PCS 29.28, -2.00, SP 55.56 into 11th - all three passes looked under, and who would've thought You would potentially be last going into the free?  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

TES 38.75, PCS 31.96, -1.00, SP 69.71 into 1st - good lord, those PCS should've been 34-35, not because they need to be inflated but because that's what she deserves  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332226474447953922 2020-11-26 23:35:17 -0800 <rockerskating> Wakaba Higuchi should go in front with that program, but they are gonna be like, nah PCS tho  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332226319514480641 2020-11-26 23:34:40 -0800 <rockerskating> Wakaba Higuchi JPN 3A(q?fall), 3Lz3T, 3F(e?) - this program continues to get better and better; her decision to put the 3A in the SP shows how confident she must be on that jump in practice; hoping it'll hit tomorrow  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332222891858014209 2020-11-26 23:21:03 -0800 <rockerskating> Yeah, Marin Honda should be like 35 in PCS but they're not gonna give her that  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332215668486320129 2020-11-26 22:52:21 -0800 <rockerskating> Tomoe Kawabata JPN 3Lz3T, 3Lo(turn), 2A(step) - even with that turnout on the loop, I'd very much have this program in front, Kawabata's skating is heads above the rest so far ... and then the axel stepout (sigh)  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332215261827633153 2020-11-26 22:50:44 -0800 <rockerskating> Wow, the reset on the slightly overrotated lutz to launch the 3T was so good from Kawabata - that combo could've really gone off the rails  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

It requires you to be pretty steady on skates because it’s real tough to learn how to skate in new boots
1331760100965572610 2020-11-25 16:42:05 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 Then talk to your coach / pro shop about it. I’ve always been with @JohnWilsonBlade from beginner standard blades to advanced double/triple jump blades. I got into @edeaskates boots very recently and I really like them, but they are different than normal
1331759634907099138 2020-11-25 16:40:14 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 Gotta say, I’m not the most knowledgeable about where to start (I don’t even remember how I got started with skates - I think my group lessons coach just said, go get these!). If I were you, I would start with rental skates first and get used to skating / take some lessons

1331438425015267328 2020-11-24 19:23:52 -0800 <rockerskating> @aprimo224 He did. But this post is about Urmanov’s 4T and I didn’t say anything about this being the first quad toe.

1330968023835013121 2020-11-23 12:14:39 -0800 <rockerskating> @SASgrafix @grasshopperay You can do triple-triple-triple, but it doesn’t make sense from a calculation standpoint. I wrote a whole tome on it at the Olympics:  https://t.co/uI4yKxpIUA
1330739202913398786 2020-11-22 21:05:24 -0800 <rockerskating> @BrownJefe I just rewatched both Euros and Worlds versions. The flip in both programs almost identical :(
1330739043265617921 2020-11-22 21:04:46 -0800 <rockerskating> @grasshopperay @SASgrafix I mean, technically it’s not “disallowed” - it’s more than only the first 3 jumps will count toward the combo
1330720087175819264 2020-11-22 19:49:27 -0800 <rockerskating> @BrownJefe I’m still sad she fell on that 3F in 1994 in her FS and it kept her off the Worlds podium
1330714299745120262 2020-11-22 19:26:27 -0800 <rockerskating> @VM2022Beijing Marina Kielmann. This was in 1993, so I think Slutskaya was 12 or 13 at this point

1330322752444706820 2020-11-21 17:30:35 -0800 <rockerskating> Yes they can, especially for someone whose needs to concentrate on their skating skills to make them good. Taking the time to focus on edge quality and power stroking is an art in itself. It’s not a given.
1330296885173768197 2020-11-21 15:47:47 -0800 <rockerskating> @katrenmet It indicates that it's a sequence (not a combo), which means the base value is calculated differently - combo is 100% of the jumps added together, sequence is 80% of the jumps added together

1332604028979699715 2020-11-28 00:35:33 -0800 <rockerskating> I’ll say it again: the introduction of the q in the IJS is a step backward.   Calling a jump “exactly 1/4 rotation” short requires a level of precision that doesn’t exist. When you can exactly measure direction of takeoff w respect to blade positioning at landing, then let’s talk

1332604028979699715 2020-11-28 00:35:33 -0800 <rockerskating> I’ll say it again: the introduction of the q in the IJS is a step backward.

1332229397462605824 2020-11-26 23:46:54 -0800 <rockerskating> Kaori Sakamoto JPN 2A, 3Lz(e?), 3F3T - upgraded her program to backload the combo and put the lutz in over the loop; the lutz edge is still not totally reliable, but it's a good place to give it a shot; this will go into 1st  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332228781168353280 2020-11-26 23:44:27 -0800 <rockerskating> Young You KOR 3A(ur,fall), 3Lz(ur?fall), 3F3T(ur) TES 28.28, PCS 29.28, -2.00, SP 55.56 into 11th - all three passes looked under, and who would've thought You would potentially be last going into the free?  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

TES 38.75, PCS 31.96, -1.00, SP 69.71 into 1st - good lord, those PCS should've been 34-35, not because they need to be inflated but because that's what she deserves  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332226474447953922 2020-11-26 23:35:17 -0800 <rockerskating> Wakaba Higuchi should go in front with that program, but they are gonna be like, nah PCS tho  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332226319514480641 2020-11-26 23:34:40 -0800 <rockerskating> Wakaba Higuchi JPN 3A(q?fall), 3Lz3T, 3F(e?) - this program continues to get better and better; her decision to put the 3A in the SP shows how confident she must be on that jump in practice; hoping it'll hit tomorrow  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332222891858014209 2020-11-26 23:21:03 -0800 <rockerskating> Yeah, Marin Honda should be like 35 in PCS but they're not gonna give her that  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332215668486320129 2020-11-26 22:52:21 -0800 <rockerskating> Tomoe Kawabata JPN 3Lz3T, 3Lo(turn), 2A(step) - even with that turnout on the loop, I'd very much have this program in front, Kawabata's skating is heads above the rest so far ... and then the axel stepout (sigh)  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332215261827633153 2020-11-26 22:50:44 -0800 <rockerskating> Wow, the reset on the slightly overrotated lutz to launch the 3T was so good from Kawabata - that combo could've really gone off the rails  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

It requires you to be pretty steady on skates because it’s real tough to learn how to skate in new boots
1331760100965572610 2020-11-25 16:42:05 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 Then talk to your coach / pro shop about it. I’ve always been with @JohnWilsonBlade from beginner standard blades to advanced double/triple jump blades. I got into @edeaskates boots very recently and I really like them, but they are different than normal
1331759634907099138 2020-11-25 16:40:14 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 Gotta say, I’m not the most knowledgeable about where to start (I don’t even remember how I got started with skates - I think my group lessons coach just said, go get these!). If I were you, I would start with rental skates first and get used to skating / take some lessons

1331438425015267328 2020-11-24 19:23:52 -0800 <rockerskating> @aprimo224 He did. But this post is about Urmanov’s 4T and I didn’t say anything about this being the first quad toe.

1330968023835013121 2020-11-23 12:14:39 -0800 <rockerskating> @SASgrafix @grasshopperay You can do triple-triple-triple, but it doesn’t make sense from a calculation standpoint. I wrote a whole tome on it at the Olympics:  https://t.co/uI4yKxpIUA
1330739202913398786 2020-11-22 21:05:24 -0800 <rockerskating> @BrownJefe I just rewatched both Euros and Worlds versions. The flip in both programs almost identical :(
1330739043265617921 2020-11-22 21:04:46 -0800 <rockerskating> @grasshopperay @SASgrafix I mean, technically it’s not “disallowed” - it’s more than only the first 3 jumps will count toward the combo
1330720087175819264 2020-11-22 19:49:27 -0800 <rockerskating> @BrownJefe I’m still sad she fell on that 3F in 1994 in her FS and it kept her off the Worlds podium
1330714299745120262 2020-11-22 19:26:27 -0800 <rockerskating> @VM2022Beijing Marina Kielmann. This was in 1993, so I think Slutskaya was 12 or 13 at this point

1330322752444706820 2020-11-21 17:30:35 -0800 <rockerskating> Yes they can, especially for someone whose needs to concentrate on their skating skills to make them good. Taking the time to focus on edge quality and power stroking is an art in itself. It’s not a given.
1330296885173768197 2020-11-21 15:47:47 -0800 <rockerskating> @katrenmet It indicates that it's a sequence (not a combo), which means the base value is calculated differently - combo is 100% of the jumps added together, sequence is 80% of the jumps added together

1328114784294871041 2020-11-15 15:16:54 -0800 <rockerskating> @angel_ponders Nothing sinister. Big changes like that only happen after the Olympics are over. It’s too much of a strategy change for everyone because the goal is always to optimize for the Olympics if you expect to get there
1328113760880517121 2020-11-15 15:12:50 -0800 <rockerskating> @angel_ponders I expect to see that happen after 2022
1328112094731001857 2020-11-15 15:06:13 -0800 <rockerskating> But the TES/PCS differential has been broken for years, if your goal is for TES &amp; PCS to be more or less equal if you have a clean program w the highest difficulty &amp; highest skating quality  Plus, women are doing 3As / quads, so their TES is now even more overweighted if so (2/2)
1328111192288747522 2020-11-15 15:02:38 -0800 <rockerskating> The short of it is, by making the men's PCS multiplier higher, it's more equal to the potential men's TES because of the historically higher technical content; otherwise, men's TES would be even more overweighted than it is now (1/2)
1328110429332180995 2020-11-15 14:59:36 -0800 <rockerskating> Las Vegas Invitational Team FINAL  Team @taralipinski 828.95 - Andrews 120.70, Shin 132.65, Tennell 140.14, Krasnozhon 138.58, Malinin 114.68, NChen 182.20  Team @JohnnyGWeir 774.98 - KChen 122.43, Liu 110.80, Bell 139.42, Pulkinen 129.46, Hiwatashi 131.40, Zhou 141.47
1328109781383602177 2020-11-15 14:57:01 -0800 <rockerskating> Las Vegas Invitational Men FINAL 2nd number = what it would've been w normal men's PCS multiplier 1 Nathan Chen 182.20 (~200) 2 Vincent Zhou 141.47 (~160) 3 Alex Krasnozhon 138.58 (~154) 4 Tomoki Hiwatashi 131.40 (~148) 5 Camden Pulkinen 129.46 (~145) 6 Ilia Malinin 114.68 (~128)
1328109184638980102 2020-11-15 14:54:39 -0800 <rockerskating> Nathan Chen / Team Tara 4Lo, 3F2T, 3Lz(step), 4S, 4T1Eu3F, 4T3T, 3A(ftdwn) - that was redemption (?) from Skate America, who would've thought we would see Chen land 4Lo 4S and 3A in the same program? TES 108.47, PCS 73.73, FS 182.20 - would've been 200 w normal men's PCS
1328108308465655809 2020-11-15 14:51:10 -0800 <rockerskating> NATHAN CHEN YOU STEPPED OUT OF A TRIPLE LUTZ  https://t.co/g0ZgRSycxy

1328107823264370688 2020-11-15 14:49:14 -0800 <rockerskating> Vincent Zhou / Team Johnny 4Lz(ur,fall), 1Lz(ftdwn), 3F, 3A3T(q?), 4Lz(ur), 3A2T, 3Lz1Eu3S(step) - hail Mary 4Lz in the second half, gutsy TES 74.20, PCS 68.27, FS 141.47 - would've been right around 160 with normal men's PCS multiplier
1328106924043341825 2020-11-15 14:45:40 -0800 <rockerskating> Ilia Malinin / Team Tara 4T, 3S, 3A(q?step), 3Lz, 2A(step), 3F1Lo, 3Lz2T - a lot of tiredness there; looking forward to seeing what kind of splash he makes at Natls (just learned a 4Lz btwn this comp &amp; today) TES 61.22, PCS 53.46, FS 114.68 - would've been 128 w normal men's PCS
1328106076831625220 2020-11-15 14:42:18 -0800 <rockerskating> Tomoki Hiwatashi / Team Johnny 4T3T, 2T, 3A(ftdwn), 2S(step), 1A, 3Lo, 3Lz1Eu3F - all kinds of base value left on the table with those pops TES 65.80, PCS 65.60, FS 131.40 - would've been about 148 if calibrated to the normal men's PCS multiplier
1328105697326882816 2020-11-15 14:40:47 -0800 <rockerskating> I know this competition was taped just 2 days after Skate America and there was also an exhibition in between, but everyone is just breathing a whole lot harder here - goes to show how much strain a full-week competition is
1328105231087964161 2020-11-15 14:38:56 -0800 <rockerskating> The men's PCS multiplier and the women's PCS multiplier were brought to the same level so that the men's PCS wouldn't be overweighted relative to the women - the men's is usually a 2.0x in the FS, whereas the women's is 1.6x
1328104848571703299 2020-11-15 14:37:25 -0800 <rockerskating> Alex Krasnozhon / Team Tara 4Lo, 3A2T, 3A, 3S, 3F3Lo, 3Lz2T(ur), 3Lz - perhaps the best free skate we've ever seen from Krasnozhon, at least in the jumping department! TES 77.39, PCS 61.19, FS 138.58 - that would've been about 154 if PCS were calibrated to the men's multiplier
1328103979918774272 2020-11-15 14:33:58 -0800 <rockerskating> Wow another quad loop from Alex Krasnozhon! It was a good weekend for that jump for him in Vegas
1328103758438551553 2020-11-15 14:33:05 -0800 <rockerskating> Must be a bit strange for the guys to see their PCS so low, basically 20% lower than it would otherwise be because it's calibrated in line with the women's PCS here
1328103552594677766 2020-11-15 14:32:16 -0800 <rockerskating> Camden Pulkinen / Team Johnny 3Lz(hand,turn), 3A, 3Lo, 3Lz1Eu3S, 3A(ur,fall), 3F, 3T2T - some very strong moments in there but felt a bit pushed through, especially if you look at the spins there; a couple more months of conditioning will help TES 67.13, PCS 63.33, -1, FS 129.46
1328102643491872770 2020-11-15 14:28:39 -0800 <rockerskating> Las Vegas International Ladies FINAL 1 Bradie Tennell 140.14 2 Mariah Bell 139.42 3 Audrey Shin 132.65 4 Karen Chen 122.43 5 Starr Andrews 120.70 6 Alysa Liu 110.80 -- Team Tara 393.49 Team Johnny 372.65
1328101844208513024 2020-11-15 14:25:29 -0800 <rockerskating> Mariah Bell / Team Johnny 2A3T(2ft), 3Lo, 3S(ur?hand?), 3F(ftdwn), 3Lz2T2Lo, 3F2T(hangs on), 3Lz - 1st half of the program looked labored but got stronger toward the end, she has a lot better in her though TES 68.88, PCS 70.54, FS 139.42
1328100684621877248 2020-11-15 14:20:52 -0800 <rockerskating> Bradie Tennell / Team Tara 3Lz3T, 2A, 3Lo, 3S, 3Lz(ur?)3T(ur), 2A, 2F2T2Lo - strange that the flip has been messing with her so far this season, a stronger skate than she had at Skate America TES 68.80, PCS 71.34, FS 140.14
1328099692870324224 2020-11-15 14:16:56 -0800 <rockerskating> Alysa Liu / Team Johnny 1A, 3Lz, 2A2T, 2Lo, 3Lz(ur?)2T, 2F1Eu2S, 2F - popped way too many jumps, just hasn't had the snap this season that she had in the past; it's a long climb up to Nationals at this point, not even about the quads right now TES 48.93, PCS 61.87, FS 110.80
1328098539239518209 2020-11-15 14:12:21 -0800 <rockerskating> Audrey Shin / Team Tara 3Lz3T, 2A3T(ur?), 3S(ur), 3F(e?), 3Lz, 3Lo2T2Lo(ur), 2A - she continues to impress, and there is certainly podium potential for Shin at Nationals this season TES 67.19, PCS 65.46, FS 132.65
1328097603867848704 2020-11-15 14:08:38 -0800 <rockerskating> For folks who are wondering / asking, the Las Vegas Invitational was taped the Monday after Skate America happened, so no one traveled back to Vegas for this event - it all happened at the same time ... great opportunity to provide more athlete funding with competition time
1328097275680337922 2020-11-15 14:07:20 -0800 <rockerskating> Karen Chen / Team Johnny 2A2T, 3Lz, 3F(e?q?), 3Lo, 3Lz(ur)2T2Lo, 2S, 2Lo2T - not quite what she delivered at Skate America, which was probably her strongest skate in a while TES 55.50, PCS 66.93, FS 122.43

1328095390671966210 2020-11-15 13:59:50 -0800 <rockerskating> This thread: Las Vegas International live - note that the PCS multiplier for the men and the women is the same to have their PCS counted the across disciplines #nohashtagsothereyougo

1332604028979699715 2020-11-28 00:35:33 -0800 <rockerskating> I’ll say it again: the introduction of the q in the IJS is a step backward.

TES 38.75, PCS 31.96, -1.00, SP 69.71 into 1st - good lord, those PCS should've been 34-35, not because they need to be inflated but because that's what she deserves  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure
1332226474447953922 2020-11-26 23:35:17 -0800 <rockerskating> Wakaba Higuchi should go in front with that program, but they are gonna be like, nah PCS tho  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

1332215261827633153 2020-11-26 22:50:44 -0800 <rockerskating> Wow, the reset on the slightly overrotated lutz to launch the 3T was so good from Kawabata - that combo could've really gone off the rails  https://t.co/ycYQYOxsXF #NHK杯フィギュア #GPFigure

It requires you to be pretty steady on skates because it’s real tough to learn how to skate in new boots
1331760100965572610 2020-11-25 16:42:05 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 Then talk to your coach / pro shop about it. I’ve always been with @JohnWilsonBlade from beginner standard blades to advanced double/triple jump blades. I got into @edeaskates boots very recently and I really like them, but they are different than normal
1331759634907099138 2020-11-25 16:40:14 -0800 <rockerskating> @shanemichael70 Gotta say, I’m not the most knowledgeable about where to start (I don’t even remember how I got started with skates - I think my group lessons coach just said, go get these!). If I were you, I would start with rental skates first and get used to skating / take some lessons

1331438425015267328 2020-11-24 19:23:52 -0800 <rockerskating> @aprimo224 He did. But this post is about Urmanov’s 4T and I didn’t say anything about this being the first quad toe.
1331437373088002048 2020-11-24 19:19:41 -0800 <rockerskating> For some reason, my walk down memory lane went On Golden Pond - this program keeps moving upward in my list of great programs of all time:  https://t.co/bAWLFbkUQd

1330968023835013121 2020-11-23 12:14:39 -0800 <rockerskating> @SASgrafix @grasshopperay You can do triple-triple-triple, but it doesn’t make sense from a calculation standpoint. I wrote a whole tome on it at the Olympics:  https://t.co/uI4yKxpIUA
1330739202913398786 2020-11-22 21:05:24 -0800 <rockerskating> @BrownJefe I just rewatched both Euros and Worlds versions. The flip in both programs almost identical :(
1330739043265617921 2020-11-22 21:04:46 -0800 <rockerskating> @grasshopperay @SASgrafix I mean, technically it’s not “disallowed” - it’s more than only the first 3 jumps will count toward the combo
1330720087175819264 2020-11-22 19:49:27 -0800 <rockerskating> @BrownJefe I’m still sad she fell on that 3F in 1994 in her FS and it kept her off the Worlds podium
1330714299745120262 2020-11-22 19:26:27 -0800 <rockerskating> @VM2022Beijing Marina Kielmann. This was in 1993, so I think Slutskaya was 12 or 13 at this point

1330322752444706820 2020-11-21 17:30:35 -0800 <rockerskating> Yes they can, especially for someone whose needs to concentrate on their skating skills to make them good. Taking the time to focus on edge quality and power stroking is an art in itself. It’s not a given.
1330296885173768197 2020-11-21 15:47:47 -0800 <rockerskating> @katrenmet It indicates that it's a sequence (not a combo), which means the base value is calculated differently - combo is 100% of the jumps added together, sequence is 80% of the jumps added together
1330295011188105216 2020-11-21 15:40:21 -0800 <rockerskating> @JohnWilsonBlade It's them blades, isn't it?

1332598342573051905 2020-11-28 00:12:58 -0800 <rockerskating> @Erinsk8 Yes, it's a -2 to -3 off what the GOE otherwise would've been had the q not been called
1332597651594993667 2020-11-28 00:10:13 -0800 <rockerskating> A q is called when the jump is deemed "exactly 1/4 rotation" short (which, in itself, is ridiculous how precise the imprecision has to be) - the base value remains the same
1332597335193477120 2020-11-28 00:08:57 -0800 <rockerskating> Wakaba Higuchi 3A(q), 3Lz3T(hangs on), 2S(step), 3Lo, 2A3T, 3F2T2Lo, 2Lz TES 64.39, PCS 66.88, FS 131.27, TOTAL 200.98 into 1st - 3A called a q, but it is technically rotated because the base value is all there, but GOEs? idk  https://t.co/VVZtXCUy6N #NHK杯フィギュア #NHKTrophy20
1332596415588159488 2020-11-28 00:05:18 -0800 <rockerskating> I can't believe they gave it a q on replay.
1332596269278244864 2020-11-28 00:04:43 -0800 <rockerskating> Wakaba Higuchi 3A, 3Lz3T(hangs on), 2S(step), 3Lo, 2A3T, 3F2T2Lo, 2Lz - axel is under review, a couple of pops but a strong skate for Higuchi, will get her in front with Sakamoto left  https://t.co/VVZtXCUy6N #NHK杯フィギュア #NHKTrophy20
1332595983671287809 2020-11-28 00:03:35 -0800 <rockerskating> It's #13!!!! Wakaba Higuchi unofficially becomes the 13th woman to land a triple axel in international competition - awaiting review but it looked clean to me even on slo-mo  https://t.co/VVZtXCUy6N #NHK杯フィギュア #NHKTrophy20  https://t.co/EL6J7FC0BO

1331865586943442947 2020-11-25 23:41:15 -0800 <chrissyteigen> @shcro1 I am in a very dark bubble and incapable of expressing what is happening and doing the best I can. I feel broken and all I know is the opposite is fixed - I know it isn’t that easy but it’s all I can think of at the moment. Did not mean to offend.
1331731771017216001 2020-11-25 14:49:31 -0800 <chrissyteigen> @crissles lol no I don’t look in there it’s a podcast-asking cesspool

1332604028979699715 2020-11-28 00:35:33 -0800 <rockerskating> I’ll say it again: the introduction of the q in the IJS is a step backward.

Wakaba Higuchi unofficially becomes the 13th woman to land a triple axel in international competition - awaiting review but it looked clean to me even on slo-mo  https://t.co/VVZtXCUy6N #NHK杯フィギュア #NHKTrophy20  https://t.co/EL6J7FC0BO
